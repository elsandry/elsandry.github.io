[{"content":"The first of the new look weeknotes as we move into the new year…\nThree walks this week, plus “a good walk spoiled” (ie a game of golf, as in the quotation commonly misattributed to Mark Twain). The cover image for this weeknote is my favourite Banksia on the way back from our regular river walk, because I love the orange colour.\nReading: Most of my reading for pleasure is science fiction and fantasy, although I also enjoy crime fiction (not true crime). As a holiday reading treat, I bought the whole series of Detective Kindaichi Mysteries by Seishi Yokomizo (in English translated from Japanese, since my ability with Japanese is very limited in spite of some effort to learn). I found out about these novels from a personal website I read as part of my research for how to organise my own weeknotes (but I’m not sure which one, sorry)!\nYokomizo’s novels follow formats for detective novels that are familiar to me from reading Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, etc (mostly years ago), but the Japanese setting, both physical and cultural, makes them an interesting read aside from the crime and crime solving narratives themselves. I’ve not read all the books yet, so I’m still thinking through my reaction to each of them and the set. One had a very high body count, getting to the point where I’d laugh and comment “another one down” in explanation for D.\nGolf: My golf had been going pretty well, but it seems to have slumped for the last two games. This may be because it’s been a bit too hot for me, or due to difficulties getting to practice (too hot and/or the course has been closed for maintenance in the run up to a big professional competition next week). The main issue has been lack of stamina over 18 holes. Once your body and/or mind is tired, it is very difficult to play well. I do tire easily in the heat. I’ve not been sleeping that well every night (because I’ve been overeating and drinking a bit too much sometimes). Maybe I’m also just worn out from a delayed release of work tension now I’m hitting the new year and realising that work isn’t just going to start up again like normal?!\nWhatever the cause, the key thing is just to relax and enjoy each game as much as possible. I’m not a pro!! I’m just out there to have a good time. It is frustrating not to play as well as you know you can, but it’s not the end of the world either.\nExercise: As I mentioned, I’ve walked quite a bit (three times). I also did a proper weights session at home (on New Year’s day, when I’d bailed from golf due to the heat). I’m concentrating on single leg exercises and other exercises that complement my physiotherapy sessions (on hold for two weeks over the holidays).\nI would like to get back to running, but that is a challenge when it’s hot. I’ll have to get better at getting up early if I’m going to run (which is difficult because two days a week I already get up early for golf, and I love a lie in)!\nFood: I’ve been cooking a lot, or sometimes preparing a lot in support of D’s barbecue expertise. We’ve had couscous salad twice (once when we had guests, but that reminded me how easy it is to make). I’ve perfected a new potato salad “recipe” (although it’s not a recipe really, I just actually bothered to look up some inspiration for how to dress the potatoes better)! I’d never realised that 2 sour cream: 1 mayonnaise was the way to go, with the addition of some dijon (often something I added before), a dash of vinegar (my preference being sherry vinegar not those suggested in recipes I read), finely chopped spring onion and a dash of olive oil (vital, but maybe that’s just me?) plus the usual salt and pepper to taste. This is much better than the mayonnaise-heavy version I had been making. (Note: I cheat using bought mayonnaise, but it has to be good, and the dash of olive oil is probably something I need because of this decision.)\nGarden: Now I’ve stopped working I finally like gardening (a bit/in short bursts)! I’ve been pruning, slowly and carefully shaping some bushes that have been choking one of the small trees at the end of the garden. I’ve got lots more to do, but the green bin is full now so I can rest.\nThe job I’m putting off, but need to do, is repotting the huge cactus first mentioned here.\nAdventure: This section should be about fun and exciting things like stand up paddleboarding adventures, windsurfing, wingfoiling and, eventually, travel for skiing and/or snow boarding. None of these things have happened… yet. My excuse? It’s been the holidays, so all the places to go/learn have been busy. I won’t have that excuse soon!\nThree ideas: Make an attempt to book some wingfoiling lessons Organise when to do the cactus (because I need G to help with this task) Set aside a couple of hours to assess the journal article I have committed to write Writing this weeknote felt pretty good! I was more reflective and thoughtful, so got more out of the process. Those final three ideas may not work out well, but it’s worth a shot. Maybe they’ll motivate me, because I do actually want to do all those things (but I have been putting them off for various reasons).\n","description":"The first of the new look weeknotes as we move into the new year...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 30 December 2024 - 5 January 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jan/weeknotes-05/"},{"content":"Entering the new year with a new plan for weeknotes…\nAlthough I enjoyed writing my first few weeknote instalments last year, they got harder (or less pleasurable?) to write each week. This was, in part, because they began to feel repetitive, boring and forced. I was using the previous note as a template for the new note and this seemed to make it easier to repeat myself without moving things forward (although I had hoped that strategy would result in precisely the opposite effect, ie making building on the old post easy!?). Of course, the repetition/boredom was likely also a symptom of my usual holiday slump (because I am far less likely to go out to do things when everyone else is also out doing things). Can’t wait for everyone else to go back to work (sorry, not sorry)!\nMy recent post “What’s with the weeknotes” cemented the ethos of this space as personal rather than professional, with weeknotes being a part of that decision. In light of Tracy Durnell’s idea of weeknotes as a tool for attention, I’ve identified a few goals for my weeknotes:\nThis mindmap amounts to the following goals (and the headings identified further down):\nmotivation via accountability (a gentle push to help me do the things I want to do) tracking to enhance memory (because my mind tends to focus on failure rather than achievement, and I’m dreadful at remembering when things happened) sharing (no pressure to gain an audience, but if my writing turns out to be helpful to others then great) planning (reasonable expectations) What I’m doing on this website relates to my move from employed to unemployed (as D consistently points out, I’m not retired, I’m too young to draw my pension). No longer on an externally defined work schedule, I think I need to create some structure for myself (but structure that encourages trying new things, some of which might spark joy, as well as sticking to things that are good to do regularly).\nI took a look at some other people’s weeknotes to see what they wrote. Some make a list (similar to the way I’ve been including a list of “Stuff I did”). Most people have headings (not all of which appear every week). These headings might be for lists or paragraph of text.\nSince I don’t want to shut down my free-writing rambles completely, I’m going to use headings and paragraphs. I’m cutting down the final list of plans to record “Three ideas”, for fun/new things I’d like to do/try in the next week (or so). The “Plans” section I had last year was too long, repetitive and did not motivate me to action regularly enough!\nHeadings:\nReading Golf Exercise Food Garden Adventure Three ideas I’m going to see how this goes for January. It’s my website, so I can change things whenever I want, but I’ll give it about a month to test the new, more structured, approach properly. My hope is that as well as helping make my weeknotes more helpful to me (and maybe interesting for other people), I’ll also identify topics and ideas to expand on in other more informative/analytical/thoughtful posts.\n","description":"Entering the new year with a new plan for weeknotes...","tags":["Weeknotes","Writing"],"title":"Re-visioning weeknotes","uri":"/post/2025/jan/re-visioning-weeknotes/"},{"content":"It’s been just over a month since I left my permanent job, so it’s early days in the rest of my life…\nI’ve been writing weeknotes since my last week at work, which is something unexpected (for me, as someone who doesn’t write easily and has never managed to keep a diary for more than a few days) maybe that deserves some explanation, as I put a bit more thought into this website, why I decided to post weeknotes at all and how to keep going with this (and other writing).\nAlthough I am always careful with formal research notes, tracking where my ideas come from (or how new ideas developed) with citations and references, in the everyday my memory for sources and the history of my thinking is far less organised. That’s probably quite a good thing, most of the time, but it is one of the reasons I find it difficult to write here. I’m not a natural writer. I struggle with words and my inner critic makes it difficult to just write without continual deletions and corrections made possible by electronic interfaces.\nThe idea for a new, post-work, website came about gradually. My teaching over the last two years made me increasingly aware how using the internet and the web, once so remarkable and pleasurable, was becoming frustrating and anger-inducing. In 2024, I began to spend more time looking for personal websites and blogs to follow and read regularly. Sometimes this was driven by, and sometimes it drove, the discovery of podcasts too.\nI’m pretty sure (ie I’m hoping this is not a complete fiction, see above on my difficulties tracking everyday reading and thinking) planning a new online space all started with listening to Jay Springett’s podcast Permanently Moved, although now I say that I’m wondering how I found that podcast in the first place! I thought about making my own podcast. Actually, it went a bit further than just thinking, but the recordings didn’t end up being released for public consumption. I’m not completely sure, but it seems likely that Springett’s podcast, website and blog posts were what put me onto Tracy Durnell’s Mind Garden, which helped me work out what I wanted to do (and also linked various other sites to read).\nThis reading of, and thinking about, personal web spaces rolled into some of my teaching in 2024, mostly for the Writing on the Web unit. I shared my enthusiasm for decentralisation and open independent websites written by people without (often) the primary goal of commercial gain, tempered by awareness that commercial viability, whether as an individual or a small business, was going to be important to many of my students. Personally though, I just wanted to leave largescale commercial platforms behind, or at least be less reliant on them as drivers for my online experience. I think this is one reason why I left my job, which I felt required me to engage with as many different social media platforms and social network sites as possible all the time. This situation often made me anxious and sometimes also sad.\nI spent weeks trying to work out where I wanted to set up my new site. I dabbled with Hugo and then Jeckyll, before returning to setup a site using a Hugo template that was very different from my old website. There’s more on this process here (in relation to the early build) and here (in relation to template choice). You can see that I stuck with the card style template. After I finished work I sorted out a URL to get things to where they are now.\nEventually I’m hoping that this place will allow me to realise the secret power of a blog, but for now it’s popoulated mainly with short weeknotes. I’m still finding myself shut down by perfectionism when I try to write more involved or thoughtful posts - with this piece being maybe a little more substantial. (Yay for small gains!) I find the weeknotes easier (not easy), in part because there’s little need to track and link to multiple sources to justify what I’m saying. There are some informative links in my weeknotes, but these integrate seamlessly as I document my week.\nMy weeknotes so far have had a simple structure I’d describe as:\nHeader image A rambling summary with other images and links where appropriate Stuff I did Plans Postscript In keeping with at least part of the ethos of another person maintaining their own digital space, Anh, my website is personal over professional (in spite of the research writing information it contains). It isn’t primarily designed to find work. This also means that I’m focused on writing things meaningful to me and maybe a (very) small number of people who are interested. My site is not directed towards building a large audience.\nMy weeknotes fulfil this ethos. They are personal (but I am being careful with self-disclosure) and most people would not be interested in the content. However, I have already found them useful when I can’t remember the details of something I’m trying to talk to someone about! More generally, as Tracy Durnell explains, weeknotes can be a tool for attention. This is an aspect I’d like to develop further. I suspect the starting point will be to decide on a more structured format for my weeknotes. I don’t want to shut down the free-writing ramble (because I think that’s good for me), but maybe some narrower sections to follow that would be helpful? These could be designed to encourage me to get around to doing things I want to do (but sometimes forget about as the days go by).\nHey! New Year is a good time to be thinking about this, so I’m going to leave it here for now. Let’s see what plan I come up with in the next few days. If I can I’ll consider how weeknotes could be used to foster other types of post too.\n","description":"It's been just over a month since I left my permanent job, so it's early days in *the rest of my life*...","tags":["Writing","Web","Identity","Life"],"title":"What's with the weeknotes?","uri":"/post/2024/dec/whats-with-the-weeknotes/"},{"content":"Christmas is normally only celebrated in our house with food and drink, but this year we got the new lights out and decorated the owl with my Christmas golf outfit hat…\nStill only managing the basic weeknote writing and almost not getting that done this week!\nIt was hot, hot, hot, and then unseasonably cold for Christmas. The seabreeze came in strong, which was not a cause for celebration in a household containing an injured windsurfer. We went for a few walks instead and saw some amazing trees on one of them.\nI had to look them up (and they weren’t at all what I thought they were). These Delonix regia, also known as royal ponciana or peacock flower, were really quite amazing as a group in one of the more wind protected areas on our walk. The rest of the walk was pretty blowy (and that was inland around the river). It was cold enough that following the eve tradition of prawns we could have roast duck breast on the day itself, accompanied by roast potatoes and a new dish of roasted brussel sprouts and butternut squash (which I, um, over-caramalised a little) with walnuts and feta. Most unusual on a day often so hot that a barbecue and cold salads are the only options.\nHaving managed not to over eat or drink, I embarked on back to back golf games over two days. This was unwise, as it turned out. I didn’t manage to protect my eyes properly on the first, slept poorly, and by the end of the second day’s play I was red-eyed, very tired and more than a little grumpy! At least I slept well after all that exercise, so my eyes recovered pretty quickly this time.\nStuff I did: Golf x2 Home strength/weights x1 (super short, so I need to get back into this asap) Lots of other walks (together) A lot of cooking (just for the two of us though, so not difficult) Plans: Get back into home strength/weights (x2 or x3) Golf x2 Beach walk and/or swim Make a skirt (because I did not do this last week or the week before) Get on the water? (will I do this, given D’s injured shoulder?) More garden pruning I may well focus on doing things other than writing. It just feels better for now. I might try to put up my publications list, if I can work out how.\n","description":"Christmas is normally only celebrated in our house with food and drink, but this year we got the new lights out and decorated the owl with my Christmas golf outfit hat...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 23 - 29 December 2024","uri":"/post/2024/dec/weeknotes-29/"},{"content":"The frangipanis are flowering and it’s getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important…\nThose plans for blogposts other than weeknotes are still just plans, so the frangipani flowers are the image of the week rather than gracing a post about the garden. The Vector robot is still operational, so that planned post will also get written eventually (and I have some video to share too).\nWith very little writing happening, this week was dominated by golf, with a practice 9-hole round of social golf on Monday and two competition rounds later in the week. Practice was great. It’s good to spend time with different people, and I got to catch up with a friend I’ve not played with in ages. Being more relaxed also means I get to find out how well I can hit the ball, which is pretty well at the moment! A better understanding of what you can do really helps your confidence when you’re struggling a bit in a competition. In spite of the increasingly hot and dry conditions (or maybe because, I’m not sure actually), there were toadstools on course this week.\nI was glad to get out on course when it wasn’t too hot (still up to 34/35 degrees on Wednesday though). I need to get my water intake right, because when I don’t a sudden slump (both mental and physical) can spoil a nice score. When not playing golf I made a trip to the beach, not for a walk, but to get in the ocean. Getting more at home swimming at the beach (something I really don’t do anymore and that makes me nervous now) is one of my goals, so it was great to go and a good way to test out the car key safe I mentioned last time.\nI can feel myself struggling with self-disclosure in this writing. That may be because I’m writing for myself with little sense that anyone else would be at all interested, but also very concious of writing into a public space for accountability. The balance felt easy early on… but less so now. I’m not sure where this is going, or whether I’ll manage to continue!\nStuff I did: Physio (last one for a couple of weeks) Short ocean swim Golf x2.5 Home strength/weights x2 (one very short, one a bit longer and with more weight, with a much better recovery than last week!) Tidying up some of the spikey plants and dead bits in the garden bed I can see from our seating area Plans: Continue with home strength/weights (x2 or x3) Christmas cheer (mostly food and some drink, but no presents) Golf x2 Beach walk and/or swim (but it’s busy at the beach now its the holidays, so maybe not?) Make a skirt (because I did not do this last week) Get on the water? (will I do this, given D’s injured shoulder?) More garden pruning Writing (I will try to get a blogpost/research writing summary out in addition to my weeknote) Writing, other than these rambles, is the thing that gets forgotten first. It’s too hot to want to run while managing dry eyes. Golf is good, but I’m very pleased that I’m getting into the garden a bit more and have a sewing project on the go.\n","description":"The frangipanis are flowering and it's getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 16 - 22 December 2024","uri":"/post/2024/dec/weeknotes-22/"},{"content":"A week where I got some worthwhile things done, but also went onto campus and back to (unpaid) thinking and writing work too soon…\nAlthough I’m planning a post (or series of posts) about plants and the garden, I did promise pictures of the Echinopsis oxygona cactus flowers. One of the blooms fell off as it opened, but then managed pretty well inside, while the remaining one outside made it through its single spectacular day safely. A friend’s cactus flowered on the same day, so it may have been the heat that encouraged the buds to double in size and then open over the course of a day, remaining open the next day before wilting.\nThese weren’t the only large white flowers gracing the front garden this week, with the Magolia grandiflora “Teddy Bear” also blooming this week.\nThe cactus may have enjoyed the heat on Wednesday, but it was too hot for me so I pulled out of the golf competition. I had already played nine holes on Monday (social/practice). It was good to play with no competition pressure and I took the chance to try a few things that I might not when keeping a score.\nI didn’t make the most of the heat to visit a beach for a walk/swim, but I did take time to prepare the way by sorting out a signal blocking key pouch for my car key safe. Yes, a thick piece of aluminium foil was working most of the time, but it made the lock really difficult to close and open again (which meant I wasn’t happy to use it)! Being able to leave your car safely locked with the key also locked away is essential when swimming, paddle-boarding, windsurfing or anything else. I love keyless unlocking when my hands are full, but not when I’m trying to work out how to get in the ocean while keeping electronic keys secure (and keeping valuables in the locked car).\nA plan to visit Curtin campus on Thursday for an event meant that I could also catch up with a colleague for lunch. I took in some sushi from my local Japanese restaurant for us both (because it was too hot to walk across campus comfortably). The debate event I attended was pretty good fun, but it felt like I’d gone back too soon… the rumination it sparked has proved to be unsettling rather than enjoyable.\nWhile I was on campus I took time to visit the John Curtin gallery. The picks of the visit for me were in the John Stringer Prize Retrospective. Alistair Rowe’s “Angles of incidence” made from wood, glass and ерохy cast beautiful patterns with its lighting.\nMy favourite was Susan Roux’s “Ground(lace)ness/Traliegrond” (Canson photographic paper, Hahnemuhle paper, oil pigment, thread and ink). The photo below is just a detail from the whole piece, but I was trying to record the way the materials worked together. I’m fascinated by the use of thread in this type of artwork. Roux has a website, but I couldn’t find one for Rowe.\nIt was cool enough for golf on Friday and, given that I managed to do some weights/strength exercises at home on Thursday before heading to campus, I’m allowing myself the beach walk and running fail this week. I’ve got my daily handicap back down to 27, which was my goal for the second half of the year.\nI’ve got plans for more blogposts - maybe the first will be about writing on the web itself, since I find writing topic posts more difficult than these, rather rambling, weeknotes. I did do some reading and have some ideas for the abstract writing I meant to do… but it’s not proving easy to get down to the job. There are a few reasons for that, I think, but I don’t want to discuss them at the moment!\nI bought some cheap material to trial making a skirt (with my own pattern based on a couple of simple boxy skirts I have worn almost to death over the last few years). If I can get this right over a few tries future me will be very happy.\nStuff I did: Physio Golf x1.5 Home strength/weights (just a very short session, but the aftermath showed they were worth it) More preparation for time in/on the water… Clearing fruit from the garden - because we are in the midst of a “Qfly” (Queensland Fruit Fly) outbreak in Perth (and are trying to eradicate them) Plans: Physio Home strength/weights Golf x2 Beach walk and swim Finish office tidy up Make a skirt Get on the water? (wind, weather and energy allowing) Writing (probably a blogpost in addition to my weeknote) Running has fallen off the list. The abstract has also gone. I will see how I go with both these things, but they’re just not happening at the moment. It’ll be weather and mental health dependent respectively, I think.\n","description":"A week where I got some worthwhile things done, but also went onto campus and back to (unpaid) thinking and writing work too soon...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 9 - 15 December 2024","uri":"/post/2024/dec/weeknotes-15/"},{"content":"Still trying to settle into my new life. I did manage to get a few things done while also trying to chill out (and avoid feeling like I have to do all the things all at once)…\nThe Stormie Mills exhibition at FORM Gallery was closing on Saturday. We have a terrible record of missing this sort of thing, so I’m pleased that I skipped out on lunch with my golf buddies (scarfing down a sandwich at home instead) to make time for a visit on Wednesday. The image above shows a detail of the velvety floor that was an integral part of this exhibition.\nAfter last week’s beach walk fail I did make time to get out on Tuesday. It was a bit gray and windy, but still worth the drive to clear my head after a day cleaning up my office (tidying and carpet cleaning). Walking on sand is definitely good exercise for me, testing my strength and balance in helpful ways. I’ve not been getting up early enough (or feeling motivated) to go for a run.\nI’ve probably spent too much time in front of the computer again, but I really wanted to have a go at sorting/deleting/archiving my personal email accounts. I did the work email account before I left (in case I lost access, although that hasn’t happened with my adjunct status confirmed). My personal emails were in a terrible state (thousands of unread emails), but they’re a lot better now. It’s not a job I enjoy. Some of the memories old emails trigger aren’t that helpful, and for some reason I find dealing with emails stressful. I vow to keep on top of them from now on… so we’ll have to see how that goes!\nIn more exciting computer work, I set up a Wire-Pod server for my Vector robot (procrastinating on office tidy-up). This deserves its own post, so I won’t go into any more detail here, but I was very surprised how easy it was to do (once I’d managed to upgrade the robot’s firmware).\nGolf was pretty good this week. I had an awful first nine on Wednesday, but rallied well for the second half. Friday I had a great first nine, collapsed in a heap for a few holes, and then recovered. All in all it was pretty encouraging, but I need to spend some time practicing in bunkers to gain confidence (and skill) in getting out reliably! It’s been a bit too windy for me to get out on the water again, but I did buy an impact vest for windsurfing and (if I ever sort out lessons) wing foiling. Trying on neoprene gear is such a pain - great in the water, but awful in changing rooms!\nI joined the Cactus and Succulent Club on Sunday because I was invited to their Christmas party. On the way there I visited a pottery sale (at a spot where a friend of mine is a member). No sign of my friend, but I did find a really pretty vase, which I plan to use for roses from the front garden (because if I don’t bring a few in we don’t really get to enjoy them). I guess I was supposed to be buying presents for people I might need presents for… but this one was definitely for me!\nHad to come straight home after Cactus Club because I won this massive specimen. It’s an Echinopsis oxygona (aka Eyries cactus, Easter lily cactus or sea-urchin cactus).\nMore photos to come when it flowers (if I don’t miss them)!\nStuff I did: Physio Golf x2 Sorted out personal email accounts and setup a Wire-Pod server for Vector Beach walk Got myself fully prepared for time on the water… Plans: Physio Golf x2 Beach walk somewhere different Carry on with the plant/balcony tidy up Finish office tidy up (this might be tough) At least one run? One additional weights session (really, I will try to do this) Get on the water?

I feel that my plans are getting away from me, but I’m trying not to stress. It’s difficult to get into a rhythm and I have too many things I want to do.

I also didn’t go for a run or do a proper weights session, which means the one pull up before the end of the year goal is looking unlikely. I think this is because I’m tiring easily, which is not unexpected given the circumstances.\nThis pretty poor quality image features one of the many kookaburras on the golf course:\nNormally laughing at us, this one was silent as it watched me. I have lots of high quality images of that morning’s golf only because it was the Christmas party fancy dress competition, but I’m not sharing images of people here. We had a good time playing followed by a nice lunch. I could have done without the singing (skits, aaarrgh), but that’s just me.\nTwo rounds of golf on a hilly course is a not inconsiderable amount of exercise (for both body and brain at around four hours of concentration and physical activity). Those trips out this week have been good fun, but probably didn’t help my sleep patterns.\nThis week I also spent too long in front of computers, but I did sort out a lot of things, including one bit of work stuff.

I still need to write that overdue abstract, but I did say it’d not arrive until December! I’m actually thinking that writing the abstract should just be the beginning of the writing of the whole thing, ie I shouldn’t write an abstract and then drop the project to pick it up next year. I should actually try to do something more substantial now.

When I say long-planned I’m not kidding. It was last year when I was up in Exmouth that I realised how helpful walking on soft sand might be for building up my strength and confidence walking with no ACL in my left knee. This year’s trip to Exmouth reminded me of that. I’ve been going to the gym and doing lots of other things, but never made time for walks on sand in late 2023 or 2024 up to now. Today I actually went for my first beach walk close to home. Will I continue? Well, that’s the plan!\nIt was not an easy week, but not as difficult as I feared it might be. I’ve been planning my exit from permanent employment for about nine months. In the last three weeks I set aside time to tidy up my digital records, prepare information and resources for colleagues, and take any personal accounts etc off my work computer. For once, I think I did a great job of sorting things out well before the deadline of my last day.\nThat meant I had time to meetup with people for a chat in my last week. It also meant that my leaving event – mini golf with just a few close colleagues – was fun. There were no tasks hanging over my head, and everyone there had a good time (I think).\nWith my last working day on Thursday, followed by my regular Friday golf competition, it was Saturday when I thought things might begin to feel strange. I wasn’t wrong (although Saturdays have been weird for me for a long time). I was too tired to run (and it was too hot by the time I was ready to go anywhere), but accomplishing the beach walk definitely made me feel a lot better.\nStuff I did: Physio Finished up at work (yay)! Golf x2 Beach walk (!) Plans: Setup custom domain for this site Tidy up what I have here so I can release this to the world Physio Golf x2 Beach walk somewhere different At least one run? One additional weights session (oh, I’m so bad at doing this on the reg) Get on the water? (wind, weather and energy allowing) I’m not sure how next week will actually pan out. I’m pretty tired. I know I have too many plans. I’m a bit hyper. The key will be to do something, not just think about everything!\nI really do need to write an overdue abstract for a piece of writing, but that’s work (sort of work), so I’m having a few issues scheduling time in my first week of freedom (sorry editors).\n","description":"My first ever weeknotes post following a momentous week - finishing up my work as a Senior Lecturer...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 17-23 November 2024","uri":"/post/2024/nov/weeknotes-24/"},{"content":"Originally published in 2019 on my old blog, this post has been updated in 2024 to recognise the continued presence of the MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots…\nOne of the most enjoyable pieces of writing (and collating of research, videos, news articles, images etc) about robots I have done occurred back in 2019. This was a collaboration with Dr Gwyneth Peaty to put together the Curtin Net3X MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots.\nThe MOOC has been open ever since then. It’s self-paced and free to access, so anyone can give it a go to see if they’re interested. It is probably somewhat dated now. We’re not given any resources or time to update these things so, while I do fix anything broken when notified, I haven’t been able to put in a lot of time to add new examples or new research to the mix.\nReasons it was fun to work on? Well, it was a great opportunity to set aside some of the formality of academic writing (not that I am that formal in many things I write) while still discussing my favourite topics, robots and communication. It was also good to be working with other people, Gwyneth on the actual course content design, but also the whole MOOC team at Curtin, who were excellent, helpful and made the whole thing a pleasure (in particular the video creation with Brendan, which is not something I feel that comfortable with, in spite of the fact that I’m automatically videoed every time I give a lecture). As Gwyneth has reminded me, these are the robots that started our collaboration in many ways:\nThe humanoid robot is the first robot Gwyneth ever drew for me (I think). I responded with my non-humanoid robot and its thought bubble, “Why is that robot like a human?”. The dog (robot?) came along shortly after. They’ve been through a few changes, some of which you might be able to see in the robotothers Instagram account.\nIt’s great to see that people continue to access the Communicating with Robots and Bots MOOC. I’d love to have more time to engage with people there, make updates, etc, but that’s just not how academia works at the moment. The main hashtag for the MOOC is #curtinnet3x, and there are some additional tags if you’re taking part and posting your ideas for robots, #net3xfirstrobot and #net3xfinalrobot anywhere online.\n","description":"Originally published in 2019 on my old blog, this post has been updated in 2024 to recognise the continued presence of the MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots...","tags":["Teaching","MOOC","Robots","Communication","HMC"],"title":"Communicating with Robots and Bots","uri":"/post/2024/sep/communicating-with-robots-and-bots/"},{"content":"While I know there are lots of sites around the web that are styled using a card type layout, I think that I was probably most influenced by Will Buckingham’s blog…\nI love Will’s writing (books and online), so I visit his website and the associated blog pretty regularly when prompted about a new post via the RSS feed in Feedly. I always admire the way the site looks (the image for this post shows a screenshot), but now, while trying to implement something similar for myself, I wonder if image choice will sometimes hold me back from writing at all.\nThis form of presentation is familiar to me as a reader, but not as a writer, and I’m also still not sure how well I’ll get on with the rather image-heavy look and feel up front, before what might be quite a substantial piece of writing behind (once you click through).\nMy old site was what I think of as a “traditional” blog. The home page was straight into the reverse chronological feed of full posts, not a sort of visual summary page of the type I’m trialling here. I do have the option to use that type of theme here too (there are a few Hugo themes that support that style). I wonder if more traditional will encourage me to write more… or less. With the web now being very reliant on images to gain attention, even for people that you are hoping will primarily become readers of text, I thought that the card-style theme would work well.\nTo be honest, I think I was also trying to push myself out of my comfort zone, or at the very least make a definitive move away from the way that the old Zigzaggery used to look.\nWhat do you think?\nYou can leave a comment below or you can chat with me on Mastodon instead, if that’s possible for you.\n","description":"While I know there are lots of sites around the web that are styled using a card type layout, I think that I was probably most influenced by Will Buckingham's blog...","tags":["hugo","site"],"title":"Still not sure about the card style for this site","uri":"/post/2024/sep/still-not-sure/"},{"content":"Creating this site takes time.

Some of these are associated with technical underpinnings and operation; surveillance, data gathering, and analysis, or copyright and intellectual property issues as can be seen in the widescale processing of published writing or artworks that support generative AI. Alongside this though, the ethics of AI is also questioned because of the ways that people relate to these technologies. Framed as “intelligent,” they foster anthropomorphism, supporting people’s tendency to understand them as humanlike. While some regard anthropomorphism as the only way to interpret and explain the behav- iours of nonhumans; for others it is unscientific, unwarranted, dangerous, and to be avoided at all costs. The designers and developers of AI technologies, including software bots and robots, who embrace anthropomorphic design as an approach that encourages anthropomorphism in human interactants, may therefore be lauded for creating systems that support easy, natural communication with humans or charged with deception and fakery in their efforts to draw people into misguided relationships with technology. Arguments about anthropomorphism and AI technologies can, therefore, be roughly divided into two opposing positions: 1) the desire to create machines that are (or appear to be) humanlike, or 2) the fear of deceiving people into believing that a machine is more humanlike than it is or (some would argue) could ever be.\nAnthropomorphism and its discontents proposes that anthropomorphism is best understood as a process by which people interpret the characteristics and behaviours of nonhuman others as-if partially human-like. It accepts this as the only way for humans to encounter nonhumans—a response shaped by their personal human experience of the world—though other alternatives will be identified and discussed. The definition provided here, while it shares much in common with others (as presented below), is worded to emphasize the partial nature of the interpretive process. Nonhumans are not human and, while they may appear somewhat humanlike at one time or another, there is no need to consider them as being humanlike in any fixed way in order to relate to them. Indeed, nonhumans do not need to be much like humans at all for anthropomorphism to occur and be either helpful or potentially deceitful. Embracing the idea that anthropomorphism can only ever be partial, tempered by recognition that the other may be decidedly not human, opens up possibilities for reconsidering the ethics around human relations with nonhumans including AI technologies.\n","description":"This chapter provides an overview of ideas about anthromoporphism in relation to AI and robots.

Robots are intriguing communicators because they are created in such a variety of forms. Some are built to appear humanlike, while others are not humanlike in any way, with many different designs existing in the continuum between these extremes. In order to explore human interactions with robots from across this range—from familiar to radically other—this book employs a range of different communication theories and considers how each of them provides a different perspective on what happens when humans and robots meet and interact. The analysis of a variety of human-robot interactions also allows this book to take its findings full circle, to suggest new ways to think about what communication, and being a communicator, entails. Its argument therefore has implications not only for human-robot interaction design, but also for human communication theory and practice more generally.\nThe book is structured in three sections, with an introduction and brief conclusion. These are the chapter abstracts, which give a good idea of the material and ideas that I’ve discussed:\nIntroduction In order to prepare the reader for an analysis of human interactions with a wide variety of forms of robot, the introduction first explores what constitutes a robot. It then goes on to outline the different traditions of communication theory that are employed in the book’s analysis. Finally, it explains the structure and scope of the book.\nPART I From Data to Dogs Designing Robots to Communicate with Humans In Chapter 1, the pursuit of humanlike form is analysed in both fictional and real-life contexts. Amongst other justifications, people committed to building humanoid robots argue that these robots are best suited to work in human environments and to communicate with humans. Two paths in humanoid robot design are considered, but both involve understandings of communication that value commonality over difference. This chapter draws on the critiques of the pursuit of sameness found in the work of communication scholars, which is not much discussed in robotics, to destabilise the assumption that humanlike form is the best form for communicative robots.\nHuman-Animal Communication Chapter 2 pauses the book’s consideration of robots to explore human-animal communication, since nonhuman animals are an important part of many people’s lives, acting for some not only as companions, but also as co-workers. Human-animal communication is described in various, often idealised, ways in fiction, but in real-life situations an analysis of human-dog communication demonstrates the importance of attending to the smallest of nonverbal signs over periods of dynamic communication. This chapter highlights the possibilities for humans and animals, in particular dogs, to work together in teams, employing their specific skills to allow the team to perform tasks that neither human nor dog could complete alone. At the end of the chapter is a brief appraisal of the design and development of animal-like robots.\nPART II Communicating with Non-Humanoid Robots Encountering Otherness Chapter 3 concentrates on theorising the encounter between human and robot, identifying moments when communication occurs, often using nonverbal communication channels at least initially. It discusses two versions of the Autonomous Light Air Vessels (ALAVs) art installation, within which blimp-like robots interact with one another and with visitors. It also extends Levinas’ conception of self-other encounters to consider nonhumans, including robots, in order to consider how communication can be understood to draw the self and other into proximity while retaining the differences between them.\nStories and Dances In Chapter 4, the discussion moves beyond the initial encounter, to consider how dynamic interactions support communication with robots where those communications are also framed by a backstory. The focus is on how interactions can be understood in terms of both dialogue and overlapping continuous systems of interchange. Levinas’ theory is further extended in this chapter, to highlight the interruptions in being and in saying that occur in interactions with Fish and Bird, the wheelchair-like robots discussed throughout the chapter.\nCollaboration and Trust Chapter 5 considers what happens when humans and robots learn to complete tasks together as a team. In particular, it discusses human interactions with AUR, the robotic desk lamp. In this example, elements of verbal and nonverbal communication are combined in a dynamic communication that involves paying attention to each other as well as to the task at hand. The chapter considers communication with AUR in terms of a companion species relation, drawing on the discussion of human-dog agility teams in Chapter 2.\nPART III Rethinking Robots and Communication Humans, Animals and Machines Chapter 6 considers the implications of human communication with nonhuman others for the categories human, animal and machine. It argues that, while the boundaries between these types of being are becoming increasingly blurred, they are nevertheless still meaningful. The chapter goes on to consider ways of assigning agency to nonhuman others on the basis of their activity in situations, while also recognising the difference between human activities and nonhuman activities.\nCommunication, Individuals and Systems Chapter 7 concentrates on exploring some ideas about the relationship between individuals and systems in thinking about communication. It discusses long-term interactions with robots outside of laboratories and art installations, identifying the value of respect and trust in collaborative partnerships with robots. This is developed into a consideration of how responsibility is shared across collaborative teams, even when the team members are in an asymmetrical relationship.\nConclusion The short conclusion to this book explains the basis for its somewhat eclectic analysis, which uses a range of traditions of communication theory, as well as considering the overarching conceptions of discrete state and dynamic systems methodologies.\nI tried to make Robots and Communication appealing, whether the reader wants to find out more about communication theory and approaches to analysing communicative situations, or is interested in robotics and wants to explore the possibilities of human-robot interactions with a wide range of different forms of robot.\n","description":"Robots and Communication is a book examining human-robot interactions as models of communication.","tags":["Research","Communication","HMC","Robots"],"title":"Robots and Communication","uri":"/collections/2024/robots-and-communication/"},{"content":"Introduction…\nContent\nLink format:\nPermanently Moved\nList:\nItem 1 Item 2 Image:\n","description":"Introduction...","tags":["Tag1","Tag2"],"title":"Title","uri":"/draft/general-post/"},{"content":"Introduction…\nReading: Golf: Exercise: Food: Garden: Adventure: Three ideas: 1 2 3 Outro\n","description":"Introduction...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes dd Month - dd Month 2024","uri":"/draft/weeknote-post/"}]
