[{"content":"Went for a less travelled river walk…\n…to see the end of the under-the-bridge art “gallery” (pictured above). Thought I wasn’t going to get there for a bit, since there were lots of signs telling me the path was closed around Heathcote and past the yacht club, but it was all fine.\nReading: This week I’ve been trying to read the first book in the Lightspeed series by Ken McLeod. I’m struggling a bit because I’m reading for short spurts and losing track of different places and groups of people. There are a number of things going on and, while I know they’ll connect eventually, I feel a bit lost right now.\nI’m thinking about reading the Aud Torvingen books by Nicola Griffith too. It was the second book in the series that was recommended on Mandy Brown’s A Working Library (one of my RSS feed blogs), but I’m happy to find there’s a set (with a number of positive reviews).\nGolf: I practiced and played twice this week. I managed to carry my concentration through 13 holes of 18 on Wednesday, but found the windy weather on Friday very difficult. I’m still not scoring well, but that’s not really my main goal. I’m focused on playing as many good shots as I can (with scoring following from that if I can only connect enough of those good shots each hole)!\nI practiced at the public range to focus on driver (following my lesson) and then on my course’s range where I spent more time working through all my clubs before taking a few drives to build confidence in my abilities in that narrower space. I used the drills from my lesson both times. All in all my practice time went pretty well, but I still had issues on course. Next week I’d like to get some practice on course before and maybe between competitions, since playing off grass is different from the mats on the range, so I’d like to get a better feel for the reality of winter fairways and rough.\nExercise: I did one two-set session and a quick one-set session of weights to complement physio. I didn’t feel like going for a run even in the sun this week, so I went for a river walk (see above) instead.\nFood: We ate well this week with a lot of home cooking. We went out with friends for a great meal at Young George. I had a meal out at a friend’s house too for vegetable risotto and a superb gateux. Lots of vegetables were consumed including brocolli, green beans and potatoes (regular and sweet).\nGarden: D was on garden duty again. Yay! I need to water the indoor plants again.\nAdventure: The river walk was less well trodden than some, but not the best if I’m honest. Adventure awaits soon (more after it happens), so taking it easy right now makes sense.\nSewing: Should I take out this heading?\nThree ideas: Leaving this in… Fit in another run? And make sure you do weights twice? It’s a lot to ask, but might be possible And this… Work on driving the ball with confidence and all shots on course Manage packing and travel anxiety (which is building) The windy weather winds me up. It’s been very stormy at times this week, and I’m looking forward to calmer conditions next week.\n","description":"Went for a less travelled river walk...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 28 July - 3 August 2025","uri":"/post/2025/aug/weeknotes-03/"},{"content":"Well, that seemed like a lot of rain (image above shows a still from the radar)…\n…which I know we need, but did we need it all at once?\nThe rain came in abundance a couple of times this week, with some very sunny weather in between. I made the most of the sun and hunkered down in the rain. I’ve noticed that I’m good at motivating myself to do things outdoors when I can, but I stagnate a bit inside. There are lots of things, like tidying/organising/making, to be done, but I’m not doing them!\nReading: This week I read the Rivers of London short story collection from Ben Aaronovitch as well as a short story from Martha Wells, Rapport.\nAfter my rush through The AI Con I’ve not done any more “serious” reading about AI other than from my RSS feed. I’m still tending to skim read most things, in particular those which go off on a negative rant (often with good evidence, but feels like it could be explained more clearly in fewer words), or seem to cherrypick positive evidence (admittedly, I’m reading this from my already tending to strongly negative position). The best, well-argued and well-written, stuff I read is from Audrey Watters at Second Breakfast and Benjamin Riley at Cognitive Resonance in case you’re looking for some reading yourself.\nGolf: I practiced twice, played one and a bit (rain stopped play) times, and had an over two-hour lesson for the price of one. My golf progress summary provides a good idea of where I’m at technically. In terms of the mental game… I seem to be able to maintain a relaxed focus for about half a round, but lose it after that (going on my scores, at least). There’ll be other things going on too (getting a bit tired, maybe not drinking enough water, etc), but I think I may be losing sight of the key swing feels and visualising shots after half way.\nMy lesson covered a lot of things (unsurprising given the length). I came away with lots of exercises and drills to try when I’m practising (and even just at home, since some are about thinking not doing). I have at least some idea of what to try with the driver now, and a better sense of what’s causing my right misses. My next practice session will be about working on this (once I’m warmed up).\nExercise: I did one reasonable (two times around my circuit) home session this week. My muscles were still a bit sore at the weekend and my double-length lesson meant I bailed on another weights session. I went for a run in the sun during the week though - which I survived without getting overly sore or exhausted!\nFood: We ate ok again. I bought a big packet of green beans and we consumed them all over the week, which feels like a mission accomplished to me.\nGarden: D has been on garden duty, since I seem to have stopped in the wet! I did water all the inside plants and cut off the dead leaves (mentioned as an overdue task in last week’s three ideas).\nAdventure: I think that two-hour golf lesson counts as an adventure given how much we talked and the ideas we covered.\nSewing: Nothing to see here.\nThree ideas: Fit in another run? And make sure you do weights twice? It’s a lot to ask, but might be possible Work on driving the ball with confidence (given my renewed, post-lesson optimism) Erm… make some sort of attempt to do one of the things on the inside list (tidying/organising/etc)? As I said above, I’m good at motivating myself to do things outside when the weather is clear, but I tend not to do any of the inside things I could do (even the more fun things, like sewing). I guess it could just be because I’m golf/exercise obsessed…\n","description":"Well, that seemed like a lot of rain...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 21 - 27 July 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jul/weeknotes-27/"},{"content":"It’s turned cold. There was frost on the practice range this morning (shown in image above)…\n…but the cold doesn’t bother me. So long as it’s not windy and raining I’ve been practising.\nWhat’s been going well Whether I’m practising or playing on course, I feel like I know what I’m doing when putting, chipping and pitching. Full shots with irons and hybrids have also been getting much more consistent and I’m gaining confidence. I get all these things wrong from time to time, but I often know why. I trust the process for the next shot and know I’m likely to see something better.\nI have a clear plan for putting practice, adding in a “round the clock” session when I have time. This has made a huge difference on the greens.\nFor the rest of my shots, I think I’ve got a good feel for taking my grip consistently in the fingers and not too tight (but should probably get this checked again by my coach). For chips, pitches and full shots (longer wedges, irons and hybrids) my practice has a well-developed setup process (that I take to the course).\nChipping practice has been going well (for both release 1 and release 2) and paying dividends when I’m on course.\nOn the driving range, I concentrate on rotation that counterbalances the club, staying balanced over the ball (not swaying) and following through to a final balance point. If I do this then, together with the work I’ve done on grip and setup, I can hit the ball satisfyingly well. Thinking about Harvey and Andy’s discussion about hidden forces helps my rhythm and balance in the shot.\nWhat’s not been going so well Inconsistency and lack of confidence driving off the tee - worst with my driver, but also sometimes having issues with my fairway wood (a 3 wood setup with 4 wood loft) - is the thing I’ve struggled with the most over the last three or so weeks.\nI did have a lesson and gained a bit of confidence shortly after that, but I haven’t been able to develop a good feel for my driver swing since then.\nUnlike all my other clubs, I struggle to feel like I know what I’m doing with my driver. Sometimes this carries over to where I use my fairway wood on the tee, although this generally has been better.\nI have been trying a few things when practicing with my driver on the range. I find the “feet together drill” reminds me not to sway and also gives me a feel for a square clubface through the ball. I’ve also been trying to rotate in a sequence that works with the rhythm of my swing keeping balance and not being pulled out by the club.\nWhen it comes together I drive the ball really well. But, just when I think I’ve got an improved feel that I can take forward and repeat, it goes wrong again, where wrong is now a slice (more often than not) when it used to be a pull/hook left. I had strategies to straighten things up if I was pulling my drives, but I seem to have nothing for the slices!! I need more coaching help with this, I think.\nI just want to feel the same confidence with my driver (and fairway wood tee shots) as I do with the rest of my game. I get that things go wrong - there’s a lot going on - but I’d like to feel I can trust my driving process and take that forward to the next tee each time.\n","description":"It's turned cold.

I read this very quickly and enjoyed it, although it is quite different from the other novels being centred on a different character much of the time. Now I’ve looked up the author’s site I realise that I could also read the short story collection too! I’ve got one of the graphic novels, but haven’t really considered getting into those.\nI eventually remembered to look at The AI Con again, but I’ve resorted to skim reading because I don’t have much motivation to read more about the problems raised by big tech AI, its creation and deployment.\nGolf: I practiced twice and played twice this week. My chipping and putting continues to improve. My game was great for the first competition and half of the second, but deeply flawed for the final half.\nI may have got a bit lazy with my setup routine in the wind and rain, but overall I think I was just a bit irritated by a particularly poor shot choice and execution which left me in the garden at one point (unable to get out in one shot).\nI’ve still got no confidence with driver on course, which leads to some half-hearted strikes that are never going to work that well (although they might not be too dreadful either).\nExercise: I did one reasonable (two times around my circuit) home session this week to almost make an hour of weights (including physion on Monday). I was not motivated to do more on Saturday, so I went for a long-ish walk instead with D.\nFood: We flaked out a bit this week, but managed to eat some vegetables! Standby poached eggs were deployed twice, a sure sign we were hunkering down, watching golf and avoiding going anywhere in the wind and rain on the weekend.\nGarden: Nope. Much to be done now after the storm.\nAdventure: I completed one of the new jigsaws I bought last week. I got so intensely concentrated that it was difficult to drag myself away and I finished it off in two days. That’s almost too fast to really enjoy the process.\nSewing: Nope. As I suggested last week. No time (around playing and watching golf).\nThree ideas: Get back to two additional weights sessions to take me over the hour a week Water the inside plants (which are living in serious drought conditions at the moment) Gah… there are things I really should do (sorry, we’ve gone beyond “could” for this stuff now) so I need to pick one thing and actually do that thing. (Time to look at How to Do Things again!) I’m continuing to be pretty active (when it’s not rainy and blowing a gale). I didn’t get around to running this week, but it’s still in my mind when the weather improves again (and maybe this week it’ll work out since I might bail on golf in the rain mid-week).\n","description":"Lots of golf and a new puzzle...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 14 - 20 July 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jul/weeknotes-20/"},{"content":"Began with rain, ended with rain, but sunny too…\n…which meant some lovely skies at times (pictured for this post).\nReading: This week I re-read the first Murderbot story, All Systems Red, because I’m watching the television version and wanted to get a feel for how it’d been adapted, given that so much is explained in Murderbot’s thoughts or “on feeds”. I think it’s worked out surprisingly well. I’m not one to visualise characters in detail, but I’d always thought of Murderbot as androgynous, or maybe even more towards female than male, so I’ve been surprised how well I’ve taken to the television depiction. I love the way Murderbot’s armour has been designed.\nMaybe one day I’ll finish The AI Con…\nGolf: It was raining at the beginning of the week, but I played two competitions and had a two-hour practice session on the day between them. My chipping and putting is getting better. As with the rest of your game, I don’t think these things can be perfected, but the more you practice the more confidence you get in taking shots and making choices about which shot to attempt. My driving is still the least solid part of my game.\nI’m sticking with my setup routine for most shots, but it doesn’t work well with driver. I seem to be better if I just take a grip on the club as I’m looking at the shot and them move around to take the drive with… calm purpose?! I’m not sure why this is and I’m going to test out how well it works to modify my process for all drives next week (since this week I wasn’t consistent). I’ve reintegrated a practice swing for all shots (again, except driver, although I think that just loose swinging before checking the shot direction might help there too).\nExercise: I did one long (three times around my circuit) home session this week on top of physio. I was very tired after golf competitions this week, and I had lots of plans after my practice session, so didn’t make time then either. That was enough to mean I’d done more than an hour of weights over the week though, so I’m happy with that.\nI did plenty of walking, but I’m considering fitting in a short run next week (weather permitting) to see if it makes me feel good… or bad.\nFood: We have a good freezer store at the moment, so that got used a couple of times this week. In between we both cooked well with plenty of vegetables in the mix.\nGarden: We did minimal tidying this week, which means there’s more to do next.\nAdventure: This week I went to my favourite small shop to buy two new jigsaw puzzles from my favourite range. I looked at books too, but I’m very tied in to reading on my Kindle (sorry), so didn’t pick anything out.\nSewing: Nope. There’s been too much golf to watch this week (and that’ll be the case next week too, I suspect).\nThree ideas: Keep doing the additional weights session(s) Make a t-shirt (?!) - left this on again, but it seems unlikely Need to do something more about the thing I’ve been putting off I’m continuing to be very active and working on my strength is good. I am wondering if reintegrating some running (one or two times) would be good, but it’s difficult to find the time and energy when there’s so much golf to play!\n","description":"Began with rain, ended with rain, but sunny too...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 6 - 13 July 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jul/weeknotes-13/"},{"content":"Pretty good weather this week meant more outside activities…\n…including a neighbourhood walk (with the pictured Bougainvillea in probably my favourite colour) being one of the sights. I also visited Booyeembara Park for the first time in years (having walked there regularly when our dog was getting old and needed short, but stimulating, walks). It was interesting to see where the mountain bike track has gone in, with lots of viewing areas incorporated into the path alongside.\nI visited Booyeembara Park because it’s next door to the public golf course range where I spent an hour or so this week trying to sort out my drives (still unsuccessfully, it seems, given what happened in competitions this week, although it was all working just fine on the range, of course). With the nice weather across a few days there was a lot of other golf practice this week as well.\nReading: I’m making a promise to myself that I will read more of The AI Con soon (since I didn’t get around to it this week as the weather was a lot better than I expected)! I read a strange crime fiction novel this week, which I’m not sure I’d recommend to other people, but I’m still considering reading the next in the series, or maybe trying out the other series from the same author. I’d like to think about this a bit more before posting any links here (or critiquing/recommending in more depth).\nGolf: I played a social round on Monday with someone I’ve not played with in ages, which was good. My play was not at all consistent, but I enjoyed catching up with K. She also (see last week) doesn’t throw down another ball as a means to practice on course, but wasn’t bothered when I did.\nI also did a lot of other practice, with a session at the public range (mentioned above) for hybrid, 3 wood and driver (which went well, but had no positive effect on course for my driving at least) and two chipping, iron/hybrid on range and putting sessions at my home course.\nI played ok on Wednesday and Friday, trying out a few things. I mostly concentrated on the grip check routine I’ve written about elsewhere, but I also experimented with using practice swings or not. That came out of the way that I’ve been hitting well on the range, but not so well on course. Often my practice swing on course seems great, but then I don’t hit the actual shot that well.\nBut, after trying with no practice swings for things other than chips on Friday, I’ve decided you can’t skip a practice swing on course. That means the practice swing needs to be incorporated into range practice sessions, so, on Saturday, I spent time on the range with fewer balls to hit, but practicing the whole of my shot routine from taking aim and grip setup behind the ball, to a practice swing alongside, a grip check and then the shot itself. I cycled through clubs, not hitting the same one twice unless I’d completely duffed the shot! It was challenging to stay focused and the range ground condition was poor (very bare after a lot of people had already been through that day), but this session was definitely worth doing and I’m going to stick with that for a while.\nBefore the range I did a bit of chipping and after there was time for some putting. I’m really putting the time into good quality focused practice, so maybe I will see some results eventually!\nExercise: I did two solid home sessions again this week to complement physio. I think it’s easier to commit to these when I’m also doing a lot of golf. I just do weights before or after practice, and it either serves to warm me up really well, or helps me recover and even out my body after all the swinging in one direction.\nI went for two walks (see above).\nFood: D did some great cooking this week and I filled in the other days. There’s a lot of things in the freezer which is going to be handy when we lose cooking momentum (as I think is likely to happen for a bit now).\nGarden: D did the tidying again this week. I was going to do some too, but then he pointed out that I might as well wait for the storm to come through before bothering!\nAdventure: This week we went to a concert. If it hadn’t been raining we’d have gone out for food too, but as it was we had a bite to eat and then headed out for Jeff Martin, who was great (if a bit weird) as usual.\nSewing: I want to make a t-shirt… at least I’ve decided that much!\nThree ideas: Keep doing the two additional weights sessions Make a t-shirt (?!) Still need to do the thing I’ve been putting off (or something about it at least) I’m pleased to be so physically active at the moment. It does great things for my mind too. I’ve written up all my recent golf ideas/changes here. I split the information up so it’s a more useful record for myself (since it is not much use for anyone else, I expect). I’ve also been keeping up a regular #ThreeGoodThings #3GoodThings posting practice on Mastodon which is a recognised strategy to improve mental health. I’m thinking about doing a post on some things I’ve been trying recently, what works for me, and what doesn’t.\n","description":"Pretty good weather this week meant more outside activities...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 30 June - 6 July 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jul/weeknotes-06/"},{"content":"In an effort to stop leaving putts short (or at least reduce the issue)…\n…I’ve been trying out a new putting drill designed to improve pace feel and confidence putting across a range of distances.\nKeeping the task simple - old and new drills I still use the drill where I have two balls and work around the putting practice area trying to putt “under par”, with par being two putts to get each ball in the hole. Using two balls allows you to hit a putt (the first for each hole is normally long-ish, so if that doesn’t go in then it should be followed by a shorter one or even a tap in), aiming for a better result with the second ball each time given what you learnt from the first.\nRecently though, I’ve been struggling with being too tentative on course. I’ve felt no confidence, leaving putts short all the time (not always very short, but rarely giving the putt a chance of going in). I saw a really simple drill online. (I think it was an Instagram reel that I didn’t save… because it was so easy to setup that I didn’t need to keep the instructions!)\nThe image for this post shows the setup. You can use any backstop you have handy, position it about 45-50 cm (18-20 inches) past the hole. In the photo above I’m using the pin’s short marker on the practice green as a backstop. Then use a tee to mark first just one putter’s length from the hole and putt three balls from there. The putts must go in or past the hole (but not far enough to hit the backstop). A short one is a fail and means you start again at that distance with three balls. If you succeed with all three balls, then you move the tee marker one more putter’s length away from the hole and try three balls from there.\nThe way this drill extends the putting distance gradually on the same line helps you build a sense of pace. This makes it good as a practice for just before a round, as well as a general practice session, although you do need to bear in mind that the pace of greens on course can be very different from the practice green if you’re about to head out.\nI enjoy this drill. So far I find I do really well up to around four or five putter lengths. I hole a lot of putts when doing the drill and it has helped to build my confidence putting.\nOn course results I do feel better when I’m standing over putts on course, but I’m still finding it difficult to judge pace out there. The first time after using my new drill I was hitting my first putts too far, because the practice area was slower than on course. Theoretically I should have been able to correct for that after the first hole, but I don’t think I was concentrating well enough for it to work out that day! I was happy that I’d not fallen into my habit of leaving everything short. More recently it’s clear that I’m still hitting some things way too hard.\nMore practice is needed, so I’ll be sticking with this simple drill for a while. Mostly I’ve been on the flat or slightly uphill for practice, so I should also try some downhill setups. My other drill, putting “under par”, still stands as a good way to practice reading slopes and seeing putting lines.\nOverall, I also need to be a bit more thoughtful on course (ie engage brain), so I’m more ready to adjust to the speed of the greens (acknowledging that can be difficult when some are slower than others at the moment).\n","description":"In an effort to stop leaving putts short (or at least reduce the issue)...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"New putting drill","uri":"/post/2025/jul/new-putting-drill/"},{"content":"I’ve done something like this before, thinking about setting the club off and then letting it move with its own momentum…\n…but this way of envisioning that process seems to work really well.\nWorking with rhythm and balance in the takeaway During my second range session, as well as all the work on my grip, I started to think about rhythm in my takeaway. I’ve seen the two ball drill before somewhere, but it was listening to Harley and Andy discussing the forces in golf that can’t be seen by observers that made me realise how useful the idea was to me, searching for natural rhythm in the swing.\nThe image at the top of the post shows some stills from the video. Note that Harley is left-handed. The images show the initial setup, with the two balls; then two stills of the takeaway where Harley sweeps the back ball out of the way; with a final image towards the top of the backswing (it’s all happening fast, so difficult to get stills at particular points).\nWhen I was at the range there was no way I was using two balls and hitting one back up the slope behind me (too risky with other people around and noone watching me), but even just visualising that process was helpful. The last time I thought of setting the club off and then just letting it swing up to the top I was less decisive and committed. This time I was thinking about sweeping the invisible back ball away and that was really helpful.\nI found I needed to watch I didn’t sway off my ball, by sweeping back too hard, but I did need to put more energy in than I had been before. It’s all a question of remaining in dynamic balance, but when you get it to flow it works really well. The club swings up, stops and swings back down with a lovely rhythm. If you’ve kept your balance, countering the forces on the way back and then after the strike with your body, the swing feels effortless, the strike is solid and the ball moves really well.\nOn course results In the competition after trying this I found it was difficult to execute the idea on course. It seemed easier to get the feel with a practice swing, not so easy when taking a shot.\nIt’s ok. I know these things take time. I’m going to need to work for a while with this drill and my grip setup, but it feels like it’s worth the effort because when it comes together it feels great! I hit some cracking shots in the competition (even as I scored poorly), so I’m totally committed to the process now.\n","description":"I've done something like this before, thinking about setting the club off and then letting it move with its own momentum...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"Rhythm and balance","uri":"/post/2025/jul/rhythm-and-balance/"},{"content":"Practice on the range convinced me I still needed to do more work on grip…\n…developing a better process to setup my grip and movement to address the ball. I’ve written a lot already about grip and setup processes, but things have been morphing while I’ve been playing. The checklists became a bit too much, and I’ve begun to think about simpler alternatives that allow me to step around to address the ball in a more dynamic way (more in keeping with the way I was trying to approach the driver.\nBeginning by setting the left hand When I headed back to the practice range for the first time I thought I had a clear plan, to work up the clubs using 1/2, 3/4 and then full shots for each one, concentrating on getting a clean strike. I met up with my coach on the way though, and by the time I got to a spot and began to hit balls I had simplified things to just easy full shots (ie not over swinging), aiming to score well on PAD analysis for each shot up through the clubs. The practice ended up focused wholly on wedge and iron shots.\nI was hitting the ball ok, but was pulling a lot of shots left. This has always been my miss and I knew that I had likely got a bit lazy with my grip setup. Although I’m very careful about what I take away from Instagram and YouTube (because a lot of it just isn’t helpful to me), recently I have been listening to and watching Adam Scott discussing his grip setup.\nPictured above (not great quality because it’s difficult to find a good image), you can just about see how it works. Looking at the shot from behind, Scott holds the club in his left hand with the clubface toward the target while it rests on the ground beside his left foot. Then he sets his left hand so it’s gripping the club in the fingers with the back of the hand to the target.\nThe image at the top of this post shows the process and result of me doing something similar. It really helps me to get the club into my fingers with a neutral left hand, but I still need to check the clubface alignment carefully before taking the shot.\nAt times, I’m finding the clubface still ends up slightly closed. I see it when I move the club to add my right hand and address the ball. Rather than letting this bother me, I just pay attention to what I’m seeing and always check the face before each shot, twisting the handle a bit within my grip until everything is balanced and aligned neutrally. This means I can adjust how I want to address the ball on a flat range spot, but also to fit the situation I find myself in on course (uphill, downhill, side-slope… erm… behind a tree, whatever).\nInterestingly, Scott has also moved away from always setting his grip to the side, paying attention instead to the clubface at address having developed a feel for the neutral left hand he needs.\nHow well is it working? The outcomes I’m getting from my grip change are good; from wedges, to irons and hybrids. Most of the time my fairway wood behaves too.\nSometimes I still pull the ball, sometimes I leave it out to the right. I normally know from the feel of my grip and swing what I’ve done and why (there can be a variety of reasons including issues with setup, what part of the clubface ended up hitting the ball, fats, thins, thick rough etc). I’m still working on how this translates into my setup with the driver, where I find varied results and errors more difficult to diagnose, but I’m trying to trust the process!\nSo far I’ve used this setup for two range practice sessions. Between those there was a warmup bucket (with such awesome results that I knew my subsequent competition round was doomed). Sorry, I just find it very difficult to assume a great warmup means a great round and, I was right, it wasn’t as great as the warmup! I loosened up the process for my Monday on course practice, but went back to it for the final few holes and reaped the benefits. The second range session was where I worked more carefully on checking the clubface before taking a shot.\nMore holistic thinking Here’s the thing… all of this work is worthwhile. The details (of grip, for example) do matter. But… hitting the ball well depends a great deal on how I’m feeling about what I’m about to do. I need to have purpose and, if at all possible, positivity. I need to be standing up tall, setting up beside the ball with a controlled tension in my body, and then I need to execute the shot in my rhythym. The rhythm of the thing is what holds it all together for me… There are other things, of course, like not swaying off the ball, being balanced through the movement etc, but those work more easily if the rhythm feels right.\nDuring my second range practice session I worked on a potential way to develop rhythm and balance… that’s discussed in the next post.\n","description":"Practice on the range convinced me I still needed to do more work on grip...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"New grip process","uri":"/post/2025/jun/new-grip-process/"},{"content":"It’s been a while since a dedicated golf update…\n…there’s been some weather getting in the way of practice and play. More broadly, I’ve not been feeling great (mentally), which leads to a lack of motivation and energy to practice. In the reverse of the well known L’Oréal catchphrase, I’ve been feeling that “I’m not worth it”. I have been playing though, and weeknotes attest to competition play including charity day events at other clubs with my regular partner J.\nBetter weather and a better mood means I’ve been getting back to practice in the last week and a bit, so I’ve got some new thoughts to record. My first session involved about an 1 1/2 hours on chipping, with some putting for dessert.\nChipping practice My chipping practice was based around the work I did with my coach ages ago, but also drew on the concept of release 1 and release 2 from Dan Grieve. The cover image for this post is a still from the video, although the differences in setup are difficult to see and another key thing is the follow throughs. I was concentrating on the shots I most often need on course (leaving release 3 for emergencies only; a feel shot that I can attempt quite successfully when I have to, although it doesn’t always work out).\nI found that with some care I could work across clubs (8 iron down to 56 degree) and ball flights (from low chip and run to a higher, softer shot). I was playing towards the pins on the practice greens in the western practice area. My aim really was to get more feel for each of these, the clubs I like to use for them, and the effect of shot style and club loft on flight and run out. When I’m out on course I often see a particular shot, low or higher, and sometimes you don’t have a choice, with the lie making a lower shot easier to execute well or the need to cover some deep rough or a bunker forcing you to go higher.\nI noticed that channeling release 1 meant I could get a bit stiff and stuck over the ball, but really thinking about moving my chest through the shot helped. As usual, having a sense of rhythm is vital for me, even though this is a short swing.\nWhen switching to release 2, the higher shot, I found the key was to relax my hands. This can be difficult to do when you’re on course (and potentially a bit wound up about the shot you’re about to take). The rhythm of these shots is naturally a bit easier to dial in, I think, because the swing is longer.\nI still take a great deal from my personal feel for chipping. I’m not prescriptive in following the releases, but some of Grieve’s other videos have backed up up my understanding of lie and its relation to shot choice, for example. They’ve also helped me when dealing with slopes.\nPutting “practice” After chipping I did some half-arsed putting practice, which just consisted of some short and then longer putts at random holes. I was a bit undirected and didn’t really feel I was working anything out, so I went home for lunch!\nOn course results The first competition of the week had some good chipping and this trend continued in subsequent competitions and on course practice sessions. I’m making better contact with the ball most of the time, with either excellent or good results. Now I just need to keep up the practice and build my feel for weight, flight and run out across even more situations.\nMy putting that first competition was often rather poor (in weight and direction). The greens have been changing a lot over the last few weeks, sometimes very sandy and slow. They’re running better now, so I was a bit disappointed by my lack of smooth putts, although the recent practice session was never going to have helped that much! I’ve found a more directed putting practice now (more on that in another post).\n","description":"It's been a while since a dedicated golf update...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"Short game practice","uri":"/post/2025/jun/short-game-practice/"},{"content":"Made the most of the sun this week, which meant…\n…lots of walks (view from Wireless Hill above), photographs of flowers (below), seedpods and cockatoos (on my Instagram here and here), as well as a lot of golf (practice and play).\nReading: I forgot to read more of The AI Con again - but I will do this next week (when it’s raining). I finished off the SF I wasn’t enjoying greatly, and it definitely improved as the story panned out. Now I’m on some sort of fantasy, probably aimed at young adults (which is not usually a bad thing, I find). If it’s any good I’ll report back next week.\nGolf: I played a social round on Monday (which I can’t call practice exactly, since the people I played weren’t on the same page as me re throwing down another ball, etc).\nI’ve been doing dedicated practice sessions again too. Tuesday was short game and Thursday was the driving range for wedges and irons. I’ve been working on my putting as well, using a new drill on Thursday focused on putting the ball in or past the hole (increasing the putt gradually). I’m going to write this up as a dedicated post next week.\nI played ok on Wednesday, and it turned out most other competitors found the setup and conditions hard so I won B grade and got nearest the pin on 17 (with a lovely 28 degree hybrid). I struggled on Friday, but it was a team competition so that really didn’t matter. I played some decent shots and putted pretty well (sometimes a bit too much pace, but I have been practising getting the ball past the hole, after all).\nExercise: I did two solid home sessions this week to complement physio, with reduced weights on arms on Saturday after my vaccinations on Friday afternoon (my arm was sore, but other than that I wasn’t feeling too bad). This meant I achieved my goal to do over an hour of weights (counting both physio and home)! I went for three walks this week and took lots of photos in the sun.\nFood: We cooked a number of good meals this week. I’m still not keeping a better record of the best things I cook, but it didn’t seem a priority this week because of the nice weather.\nWe tried a new (to us) local pizza place, which is excellent (so we’ll definitely be going back there). The pizza bases are thin and crispy but also chewy, difficult to explain, but that’s what I associate with really good traditional pizza.\nGarden: D did the tidying this week. I was too busy doing other things!\nAdventure: As I mentioned, I’ve been walking three times this week. Once was the usual loop to the river from home, but the other two were a little different and involved some bushland. Both pieces of bush contained Firewood Banksia, Bansksia menziesii or Karla Boorn Pungura in flower.\nI seem to be obsessed with Banksias now and am thinking of planting a couple more to complement the one seedling that is (currently) still alive out the front.\nSewing: Gah… will I ever sew again.\nThree ideas: Write up what I’ve been practising for golf in a dedicated post Aim for over an hour of weights again (counting both physio and home) Do something about the thing I’ve been putting off I decided I needed to be better prepared for wet weather golfing so this week I bought a waterproof hat (lucky find in my pro shop) and black waterproof shoes (far more practical in winter than the white ones I have that currently hurt my feet anyway). I also had my ‘flu and covid vaccinations.\n","description":"Made the most of the sun this week, which meant...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 23 - 29 June 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jun/weeknotes-29/"},{"content":"A quiet week watching the rain (and occasionally getting wet)…\n…so I got out one of my new jigsaw puzzles (partially pictured this week).\nReading: I forgot to read more of The AI Con and should get back to it since it’s one of the books I’ve started recommending to other people. I’m still reading that SF but not really enjoying it. I do want to know how it ends now.\nGolf: I did more on course practice on Monday with J, which is really helping. I’ve been playing better recently and that continued for Friday’s competition. I bailed on Wednesday because of the rain. According to some people Friday was worse (although I think it wasn’t given what Wednesday looked like from the comfort of my sofa). We did make it in before people were called off the course for lightening!!\nExercise: I did one two home sessions this week to complement physio (because clearly writing my weeknote motivated me to do more, even with physio tomorrow). One was very short, the other was a bit longer. That’s a bit lot better than last week, but I would like to do more. Two longer ones would be a good thing next week, or one full session (difficult to motivate myself for that though). I went for a walk this week down to the river too.\nFood: I cooked some good meals this week, although I struggled a bit to add enough vegetable to some things. Definitely should find a way of keeping track of some of the more interesting “recipes”. Thai chicken meatballs in coconut milk sauce was a high spot (with half the meatballs frozen for another day). I defrosted and used up the frozen sausage meat to make sausage stew last night with mash (which was fitting given the wild weather - warming and comforting).\nGarden: I tidied up again outside this week, but I’m still not making decisions about planting. I’ve been very lax at watering inside, with some things done this week.\nI’ve got one plant inside that is being destroyed by mealy bugs and I think it might be time to give up on trying to fix the problem. I treated it successfully last year (I remember it was one of the ones that nearly lost the battle), so I don’t know if it’s worth trying again.\nAdventure: I know that a new puzzle can’t really be called “adventure”, but it is a beautiful picture I’ve enjoyed building the last couple of days. I get obsessed with puzzles, which is one of the reasons this one has stayed in its box for so long. (I think I bought it nearly two years ago, maybe more.) Once I’ve started I find it difficult to walk away and do anything else. The concetrated effort is quite good for me though (and reminds me that I can still concentrate if I want to)!\nSewing: Shrugs…\nThree ideas: Keep up the on course practice for golf, but maybe get back to the range/short game specifics too? Aim for more weights during the week - I need to build up before August! Begin to keep a better cooking record here? I checked the skiing stuff for fit and practicality and think it’ll certainly do for New Zealand. I would like new trousers with bottom zips if I’m going to do more skiing in the future (because that’ll make accessing my knee brace much easier). Putting on my right boot is really difficult because of my drop foot. I’ve found a possible solution in the boot slider.\nI don’t think that thicker socks are a good idea (having read a bit more) and the ones I have feel ok. The boot fitter in Japan who altered my boot to fit the lump on my left foot did a great job. I never got to test them out properly at the time (since I snapped my ACL very soon, maybe even the day after, the fitting).\n","description":"A quiet week watching the rain (and occasionally getting wet)...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 16 - 22 June 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jun/weeknotes-22/"},{"content":"Doing some unusual writing and the usual activities…\n…which means I responded to the EPA against Woodside’s plans to drill under Scott Reef and played a lot of golf.\nThe image of a turtle this week was stolen from Save Scott Reef, but I hope that whoever took it won’t mind. One of the risks of Woodside’s plans is damage to habitat that supports a unique group of Green Turtles.\nReading: I’m reading The AI Con and finding that it’s more concise and easier for me to digest than the associated podcast. I’m also reading some SF that I’m not enjoying at all.\nGolf: I did some on course practice on Monday with J, which was good. I saw a little piece of advice on grip and the club face with driver, which has also been helping me reduce my right miss with that club. I didn’t go well on Wednesday, but was better for Thursday’s charity day competition. Always a challenge playing a new course, and we didn’t score well, but we had fun! Friday I played better, hit some good drives and other shots. I made par on a few holes, but most of the time my putting let me down. I just don’t seem to be seeing the putts at the moment (pace or line). I don’t have a prescription for putting, no science just art, so it’s difficult to work on anything other than getting a consistent strike (and I’m missing that at the moment, so there is work to be done).\nExercise: I felt guilty this week because I didn’t do a home weights session, so guilty that I finally did a set of bulgarian split squats before getting ready to go out. I did play a lot of golf (three and a half rounds), so have been using muscles to trudge up and down hills this week.\nFood: We went out for our usual Monday Thai. We also went somewhere we’ve not been for ages on D’s birthday and had a nice meal. I honestly can’t remember what else we’ve eaten. A couple of freezer meals, I think (which means we were both very uninspired, but saved by past us). I just saw a picture of Thai spiced chicken meatballs in coconut sauce, which I wil make up sometime soon!\nCharity day morning tea was great. Lunch was ok (but not the dessert).\nGarden: I tidied up back and front again this week. I cut back the same bushes as I cut back before because one still had dead bits and the others were still too tall.\nAdventure: Going out for two meals, the second of which was more of an adventure? Playing a new golf course? That’s it.\nSewing: I am thinking about doing some sewing soon. Honest.\nThree ideas: Continue golf practice and confidence building (regular on course practice with J is laid out for two more weeks if it doesn’t rain too hard) Check skiing stuff for fit and practicality (still to do, but I did confirm when I’d like my skiing lesson anyway) Cook something nice (ie Thai meat balls) I really need to do some research on making ski boots fit better and be as comfortable as possible. R has been helping me find things that might be useful including a tool to help open ski boots to make them easier to get on. Might check what D thinks about that, but probably will buy (because it’ll take a while to get here). More padding inside or on socks might be good, but I need to find things that aren’t wool, which is quite difficult.\n","description":"Doing some unusual writing and the usual activities...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 9 - 15 June 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jun/weeknotes-15/"},{"content":"Tired and sad, not sure why…\n…so goodbye week, hoping I feel better in the next few days. Hid from the rain. Played some trash golf (practice and competition). Saw pretty flowers (pictured) when I went for a walk.

It took a turn I really wasn’t expecting (and I’m not at all sure how it’ll resolve).\nReceived and immediately read Unflattening by Nick Sousanis. I’m not sure I’ll realise my felt inspiration to draw things out myself, but I will read it again and take in the related notes. It makes good points about communication through text and images, somewhat similar to the way I tried when writing about speech, paralanguage and kinesics. Definitely worthy of more time reading and thinking.\nGolf: I did a tiny bit of practice, which started well and then tapered off into disaster. I played one competition this week, for which my practice did not pay off (as I knifed every chip I tried) combined with pretty awful tee to green shots (with a few excellent ones scattered in just to keep me hooked). I was very tired, not sleeping well at all.\nTrying to contain my fear about going to a new course to play another charity day next week with my game in the state it seems to be in right now. Should I practise more? Or should I just wait and see… not sure, but I expect practising is better than waiting.\nExercise: I’ve done two home weights sessions since my last physio appointment, which isn’t enough, but better than nothing. They were short, but seemingly quite effective (given sore muscles the next day). I should have done more yesterday, but I went for a walk in the sun instead.\nFood: I’ve cooked some more substantial and interesting meals this week. I really do think I should begin to record some of the things I make somewhere on this site. I don’t use recipes, but keeping some kind of record of flavour and ingredient combinations and ideas could be helpful to me (if not to anyone else). More stuff went into the freezer, which is good.\nGarden: I tidied up back and front this week, in an effort to do something useful. It wasn’t a great time, but it was ok! The roses continue to flower in spite of the wind and rain. They seem confused about the season. The trees are abandoning their leaves with gusto.\nThe ravens continue to flop and caw their way around the house in huge numbers. There’s a duck that’s moved into the neighbourhood. It’s very quacky in the morning (which has been making me smile). I would like to meet the duck.\nAdventure: Nope. Can’t really think of anything that fits this category this week. Too tired for adventure.\nSewing: Should I just get rid of this section? Not while I’m trying to get myself to do the things, no.\nThree ideas: Continue golf practice and confidence building Check skiing stuff for fit and practicality prior to confirming (and paying for) my ski lesson Continue to dig steps in the side of the well in which I’ve found myself… since it feels like I’ve begun to climb upwards in the last day or so I got back to golf, but felt demoralised and found it didn’t assist my sense of self worth one bit. I didn’t build momentum with home weights, but at least I did some. I did not look for skiing preparation advice, but I have found that I can book a private lesson on the right day, which I now need to confirm (once I’ve checked I can even get my ski boots on with my nobbly foot and knee brace).\n","description":"Tired and sad, not sure why...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 2 - 8 June 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jun/weeknotes-08/"},{"content":"OMG the raven family is on the wing and ready to rumble…\n…they’re honing their flying skills, learning to “sing”, playing on the roof (in their hobnailed boots) and, presumably, stealing food from the chickens next door, etc).

Two of them went well, but my away game at a course I’d not played before was… challenging. I could not drive the ball most of the time. It got it my head, so just got worse as the round went on. Never mind. We had fun. (It was a charity day, so we were fed well and had nice company.) I let myself get cold, which was part of the issue. I also had a bad headache the whole way round (maybe related to being cold, but more likely just the early start and a bit of extra anxiety being somewhere new).\nExercise: Physio was good and I did a home session which went well too.

The dreaded slice; bane of golfers everywhere. Not feeling like I know where the ball is about to go has meant I’ve been getting more and more nervous (and tense) on the tee, which (of course) just makes it worse.\nWhat was happening? In search of some confidence, I’ve been practicing more with the driver in a space I’m comfortable with no fear of hitting anyone. As I explained before, I reset my driver to its original loft, because this made sense given the way I’ve changed my grip recently with my coach.\nFor the first practice session I was hitting my drives pretty well. The rest of my clubs, wedges through irons, hybrids and up to fairway wood, were also working.\nWhat do I mean by “well” and “working”?\nIf I’m sticking to the PAD analysis (which I find helpful) then it means first that my process (P) is getting easier to follow, more fluid and natural. Unless I get lazy, I’m scoring myself 9 or 10 on that for each shot.\nIn terms of accuracy (A), I’m more reliably hitting the ball on my start line, with its movement to the target being straight or with a bit of draw/fade. I don’t have complete control over where the ball goes, but it feels to be within an “acceptable” range. Writing this, I realise I need to quantify this better for clarity. Often I’d score myself a 7 or above, but what does that mean in degrees from target? I’m not actually sure.\nIn relation to distance (D)? Across the clubs I’m hitting for any given practice session I get fair or good contact (some fat/thin, but much fewer of these), resulting in pretty reliable distances. Again, this could be better quantified, but I’m pretty sure my scores are 7 or above most of the time.\nFor the driver specifically? On the range my process felt ok (probably not great, but it wasn’t a worry), I was less accurate or sure of distance, but nothing awful (ie really wayward). The trouble was that once I took the driver out on course I was hitting it all over the place! At that point it was over a week to my next lesson, so I set aside time to at least try a few things before that. It seemed likely that my process wasn’t good enough for the driver - meaning that it wasn’t helping me be ready as I moved from the range out to each of the different tee boxes on course.\nThe look of the fairway (wide/narrow/slope/straight/dogleg), position of the tee box (central/left/right) and the various trees and bunkers you want to avoid, etc, all alters how you feel as you stand up to take your drive. Without a solid process you can get derailed, lose focus and the ability to visualise what you’d like to do in that moment.\nIn addition, as you lose confidence with how you hit the ball with a particular club, the process of visualisation seems irrelevant. “What’s the point?”, you think. “This could go anywhere.”\nOne thing’s for sure… you’re not feeling ready to hit the ball, even though that’s exactly what you have to do!\nWhat I tried with the driver Given my biggest fear were the high misses right or left, when I got too much under the ball, I reduced my anxiety by using a lower tee. This helped. I felt like I was staying in the shot a bit more, with better contact more regularly. My misses could still go anywhere, but (in general, although it was still possible) not too high.\nThe grip and setup process were not feeling comfortable at all with driver (in spite of being fine with all the other clubs). I compromised and moved to a more neutral grip (right hand less over the handle, left hand a bit stronger again). For the time being this felt better. I also stopped thinking so much about aligning the handle with the line from my right hip to right collarbone. My focus went back to comfort and balance. What looked and felt ok? Just do that. D came out with me on course and tried to help by noticing and explaining what looked different in what I was doing between good and bad drives.\nDid this help? Maybe a little, but not enough. It got me through 27 holes of stroke. I won the final 9, which could have been weights and fitness training more than anything, since my driving of the ball was still unreliable. I knew I needed outside help!\nLesson thoughts and actions This is difficult to explain, and, as I try to write it down, I can see how my coach’s teaching style doesn’t work for everyone.\nInfluencers on the web would like you to think there are rules to setting up for different shots… but I don’t believe them and neither does my coach. In spite of saying that, I built myself a process checklist, as you know:\nStand up tall, balanced, club in right hand (* you’ve got this) Place club head behind ball with correct face alignment, right hand on top, index finger down shaft, handle and arm on line with inner right hip and right collarbone (* you have control of the club face) Take comfortable stance with feet keeping club face and handle alignment the same (* relax in balanced tension) Slide left hand into neutral grip under right hand, settling the grip by “wringing the towel”, but take care to keep the club in the fingers, left hand neutral and right hand over the top (* relaxed hands, feel club between fingers and thumb of right hand) Pop the hips to the left slightly, keeping club face and handle alignment steady (* feel the weight in your feet) Take the shot It has been helpful; however, I’ve found I need to be flexible, in particular when I’m on course. Sometimes it’s the lie, sometimes it’s because I really need to draw the ball left (around a corner) or hit the ball low (under trees) or high (over a bunker to land soft). I have played enough golf to have a feel for how to do these things and I need to respect that, without throwing all aspects of the process away.\nOf course, if there were going to be rules they’d be for driver, wouldn’t they? You’re on a tee - a prepared piece of flat turf from which to hit the ball. But it’s not that easy. There are still all those other things that alter how you feel, see and imagine what you need to do (ie the look of the fairway, position of the tee box, trees and bunkers you want to avoid, etc). In addition to this? Well, how about you, your body and how your brain perceives the world? We’re all individuals… (let’s just set aside the famous Monty Python scene here).\nSo. No rules or set formula. My lesson wasn’t about telling me what I was doing wrong technically and how to fix it. It didn’t involve going back to a set of rules for setting up with the ball just inside my left heel, getting my body into a “K” position, creating the perfect shoulder tilt, taking an open or closed stance, controlling the backswing, not going “over the top”, etc, as numerous web pages and videos will tell you (amongst many, many other things). It was about helping me to visualise what I wanted to do, get myself ready (as an individual, who thinks about, sees and does things in a certain way) and then drive the ball. Some people are looking for more direct advice than this, I think, so might not have enjoyed this lesson. I did.\nFirst, we made sure that I had a better sense of how the driver works as a tool. It is just another club, but its construction means that you need to develop a different way of looking at it to see its face as separate from its centre of mass (back from the face and more in the centre of the club). It was helpful to move the club around to feel how its weight was balanced, to get a sense of how to deliver this club’s face to the ball.\nI have never felt that comfortable with the driver - and my discomfort has increased in recent weeks - but after taking time to get a better sense of its balance in my hands it eventually felt more friend than foe.\nSetting myself up to take the shot was about visualising what I wanted to do and actively moving alongside the ball into a comfortable position looking up at my target to keep it always in mind.\nImportantly - and this was probably the only “rule” - I needed to align the club face and take a stance that angled the club shaft back from the ball towards me, keeping my hands behind the clubhead. This returned me to aligning the club handle with that right hip, right collarbone line I’m using for all my other clubs.\nI was not thinking about grip at this point. In the lesson itself I was concerned only with holding the club with two hands (however felt best), moving into position to take the shot (as above), then taking the shot. My aim was to send the ball out on the start line laid out by two alignment sticks (the first on the ground and the second angled up towards my target). Could I hit the angled stick with the ball as it headed to the target? Yes I could (at least some of the time)! Did the ball continue on a straight trajectory? Not always, no, but it all felt much better than it had.\nIn terms of ball flight, it helped to keep the club balanced in the swing, always in front of me, not falling behind. If it got out of balance I sliced the shot right (and I think this was because I fought to regain balance in the swing and bring the club back to the ball).\nWe also discussed how easy the swing could be, with force applied at the start and then again to slow the club after impact, allowing the club to do the rest of the work. I didn’t play around with this idea much in the lesson, or in my practice immediately after, but I did when I was on course the next day (see below).\nBefore finishing we got rid of the alignment sticks so I could get a feel for setting up to the target without them. I felt like I had a better idea of what I was doing, which was great. However, my brain did feel a bit fried! I definitely wanted to take some time to continue hitting balls to get a better understanding of how it felt immediately.\nPost-lesson practice I did a bit of putting to give my brain and body something different to do, then I headed off to the other range to hit some drives while the lesson was fresh.\nMy practice began focused on seeing the target, the active and purposeful setup from the lesson, then just taking the shot. I made sure I kept the angle of the club shaft back from the ball to my body (on the right hip/collarbone line) and realised that this meant the grip I had for all my other clubs with the right hand over and left hand very neutral felt more natural again.\nI hit a range of shots, both good and bad, but found thinking about keeping the swing balanced with the club in front of me helped reduce the likelihood of a slice. My problem was that the dynamic setup tended to make the rhythm of my shot feel too fast to me. That’s when my left miss came back (for whatever reason, something about the feeling of “too fast” means I hoik it left).\nI wanted to find a way to keep active and purposeful, but also build my rhythm through a calm, repeatable setup.\nWith my grip pretty much back to the one I use for everything else, it seemed possible to:\nHold the club in my right hand while looking from behind the ball at the target and picking a start line, then moving to beside the ball to place and align the club head with that start line. Placing and aligning the club head with my right hand then becomes standard for all shots.\nGet comfortable in the stance and move my left hand under the right into my grip.\nMake time for a dynamic check: waggle the club up and down to feel its balance; pull back to the body, because the handle of the club should hit just inside the right hip (and I think about my appendix position at this point… because anatomy).\nA final look at the target and take the shot.\nNote: Practice swings are separate - do that before you start this process if you think you need to get moving or sense a balanced feel. Right hand only swings can be helpful if it’s been going wrong - with right hand only, feeling the club in balance in the swing is easier.\nTaking this on course The next day it was competition time. I’ve started to warm up properly, so had a small bucket of balls to work through, all the way to driver. (It’s ok when its early and there’s noone around on the fairways left and right of the range!)\nWarmup went pretty well considering… I sliced one, then corrected that into a low pull left for the next one with the “keep the club in front” feel. This was an understandable overcorrection, but it also felt like I was losing the rhythm.\nI tried something new for the next shot, remembering the discussion about where you need to put effort into the swing. For the last few practice balls I thought about putting most effort into setting the club off and back, then letting the swing rhythm take over. Letting the club take care of itself definitely helps keep the balance. It doesn’t slow things down exactly, it’s just that you can’t rush the club. The club is still moving plenty fast enough when it reaches the ball and after (when you put some effort into slowing it down).\nMy drive on the first was great. Not all the others were, but I had a lot more confidence. While I was out on course I did all the things I’ve mentioned above and that thought, the one about starting the club and then letting it take care of itself, helped a lot.\n","description":"The driver is a club I can hit really well - one of my first novelty prizes was for longest drive at my grade - but it is also the one that tests my skill and nerve the most...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"Driving tests","uri":"/post/2025/may/driving-tests/"},{"content":"This week it’s become clear I don’t take enough photographs…\n…although that is, in part, because I’ve been trying to pay more attention to what I’m seeing in the moment, rather than recording what I’m seeing.\nAnyway, this means the image of the week is a collage of three 30x30 images I’ve shortlisted in the Curtin Fine Arts 30x30 fundraiser.

It’s solid fantasy fiction, with pretty well-developed characters and a world with varied magical mechanics. I’ve not been reading much else except for my RSSed blogs (which have been good in recent weeks, and I should share some here at some point).\nGolf: Dedicated golf posts have continued, so all I need to admit here is that practice has not yet converted into success on the course! I’ve not been playing well in competitions. At all. This may have made me a bit grumpy.\nExercise: Physio was good and I feel like I’m continuing to get stronger. I managed one short-ish home weights session too this week. It was a little spoiled by the frame I use to support my raised leg for Bulgarian Split Squats tumbling sideways… not too much harm done to me or the floor, just a bruised knee. I have a new plan for next time.\nNo running. I’ve been prioritising other things over this. I did go walking this week (away from golf as well as there).\nFood: It’s a hashtag FirstWorldProblem, but choosing what to eat, in particular in the evening, is just the gift (NOT) that keeps giving. We’ve been managing to consume plenty of vegetables and I’ve been trying to make an effort to enthuse myself in terms of recipe choice. Well, actually, I don’t follow recipes, but I do find inspiration in reading them and then making something up with what I have (or shopping for things that I’m pretty sure will work well in a vague rendition of a recipe I’ve read).\nGarden: I cut back the lower level bushes under our screening trees at the end of the pool a bit more this week. I also sorted out the bird baths and watered all the plants (balcony, front door and inside). I planted out a couple of seedlings. One was the Banksia I picked up a couple of weeks ago at the ReWild talk, the other was a tree (small and delicate, but I need to search to find out what it is) seedling from the back garden. I’m seeing if they survive out the front, because it’s either that or I’ll kill them in their pots keeping them inside for too long!\nAdventure: Not much adventure this week, unless you count beginning to do some tidying and cleaning of my spaces around the house (which is an adventure for me, given how long it’s been since I did anything like this).\nSewing: Nope.\nThree ideas: Get comfortable with my driver setup - maybe use my lesson to chat about this Keep up the tidying and cleaning Try not to panic about NZ and just help D plan I realise that the weeknotes are going ok now, and they do help me decide what to do in a general sense, although I keep forgetting the “Three ideas” section is there (and sometimes I see I’ve even been forgetting to update it week on week)!\n","description":"This week it's become clear I don't take enough photographs...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 4 - 11 May 2025","uri":"/post/2025/may/weeknotes-11/"},{"content":"“There’s a bucket full of pain”, said the guy walking towards me with his mate as I headed to the driving range this morning…\n…“Don’t say that”, I replied, “we need to keep some positivity here”. We laughed, but it turned out to be just that… positive not painful.\nWhere I went (and why) Today I skipped the range at my home course to head to the public golf course. The range there is a bit more open, with very little chance of hitting balls at anyone playing golf in the vicinity. It’s wider, longer and a bit flatter (in that the tees are less raised above the landing zone).\nI’m happy to hit my fairway wood and driver on this range (much less so on my home range). This was a key part of today’s practice, because I struggled with those clubs yesterday and I wanted to get some better feels.\nWhat I did I bought a medium bucket, which is around 70 balls on this range. I began with my pitching wedge and worked up the even numbered irons (8 then 6). Then my 25 degree hybrid as a stepping stone to the fairway wood and finally the driver. To cool down, and dial the irons back in a bit, I stepped back via 7 and 8 iron at the end.\nPractice plan It was all about setup and full shots today. I wanted to check my process (which has been developing in the last three practices and two rounds). The changes I’ve made to my grip and setup, which have knocked on to changes in my swing (I think, although I haven’t been trying to change this overtly) have almost removed the left miss from my play (not entirely, but it’s way less likely). Instead, I find I’m more often pushing things right and occasionally slicing shots (ie seeing them ballon or skid off to the right having started straight-ish), in particular my drives.\nA while back I increased the loft on my driver, which really helped correct the lefts at the time, but I realised last time out that I wasn’t seeing the club face, or feeling comfortable at address, anymore. I altered my driver back to its neutral loft (10.5 degrees) yesterday to see what that looked like to me now (with my new grip, etc).\nSetup process I was in the centre of the range, so was always aligning myself to hit straight down the middle. I wanted to make club face alignment easy today, so I could concentrate on other things. I was on a mat (not always ideal, but much better than the grass at this range).\nThese are my current setup actions and (* thoughts/reasons):\nStand up tall, balanced, club in right hand (* you’ve got this) Place club head behind ball with correct face alignment, right hand on top, index finger down shaft, handle and arm on line with inner right hip and right collarbone (* you have control of the club face) Take comfortable stance with feet keeping club face and handle alignment the same (* relax in balanced tension) Slide left hand into neutral grip under right hand, settling the grip by “wringing the towel”, but take care to keep the club in the fingers, left hand neutral and right hand over the top (* relaxed hands, feel club between fingers and thumb of right hand) Pop the hips to the left slightly, keeping club face and handle alignment steady (* feel the weight in your feet) Take the shot The hip pop helps me feel my weight balance and seems to improve my ball-first contact. (It’s a very subtle movement, not the lurch it became for me a while ago.) It is part of a trigger for taking the shot, although I find bouncing the club head once or twice is becoming a part of this too (remembering that there will be some occasions on course when I can’t do that).\nThe process is the same for all clubs. The ball position in relation to stance is more forward for the driver, with the hip pop maybe a bit more marked, as I tilt my shoulders allowing me to make a solid hit up on the back of the ball.\nAt the range (difficult on course where you might be pushed for time), if you stand too long, get too still, or don’t feel comfortable, start again!\nWhat happened and how it felt Carrying out the process I’ve described above is becoming more fluid. I don’t think I’m aiming for it to be automatic, because the thinking (“you got this, you have control of the club face, relax in balanced tension”, etc) is a key part of the process.\nThe process works well. Not all the shots were great, but most were good or better. I totally mis-hit just a few balls this morning (less than 5, I think). This is a much better strike rate than I’ve ever had before on the range. When it went wrong I often knew exactly why, could return to the process and hit the next one better. I took breaks to drink water, stretch and reset.\nThis was a good practice session. Best of all, I feel a lot more confident with my driver heading into the competition tomorrow!\nCompetition Update:\nUnfortunately my good driver feels at the range did not translate into my competition play.\nI sliced my drive high and right on the first and it was difficult from that point to gain confidence back (because I only did that once while practising on the range, and didn’t know what I’d done differently this time).\nI don’t think I was feeling that settled in the process as I setup on course. I was distracted by a few things (related to the competition, pace of play, etc). My driver shots were mosly low -ish fades, with one high miss left and a couple more high slices right one of which was fine on 13 (because there was space). It was only on the 18th that I got a solid hit drawing slightly (which is the shape I like to see).\nMy fairway wood served me well for its designated tee shots on 4 and 16, not so good on 10 though.\nMost other full shots did go well - ie my hybrids and irons were mainly good shots today (not always lucky shots though)!\nMy chipping was not at its best (but I was a bit rattled, so not relaxed enough). My putting was ok, but not good enough to save me any points!\n","description":"There's a bucket full of pain, said the guy walking towards me as I headed to the driving range...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"Practise, practise...","uri":"/post/2025/may/practise-practise/"},{"content":"A week dominated by golf, as usual, with a bit of gardening and vote casting…\n…in the Australian federal election.\nThank goodness we managed not to vote in Trump-lite and still hopeful my division might be led by an independent (although the race is very tight and won’t be decided until all the preferences are in).\nReading: My re-reading of The Traveler’s Gate Trilogy continues.

They would need a fair bit of re-organisation to make them into a working system!)\nWestenberg’s message Build your systems.\nCodify the boring parts.\nMake it easier to do the right thing.\nLet the outcomes be the natural byproduct of a repeatable process, not the residue of a rare spark. Because if it only works when you’re inspired, it doesn’t really work at all.\nQuiet and sustainable in the long term Westenberg describes systems as “quiet, repeatable, and sustainable”, with “feedback loops, structure, constraints, and long-term incentives”.\nFor me (maybe not everyone) these ideas resonate with how I want play golf.\nThe game is stressful, but it also has the potential to quiet my mind and focus my attention. It is physical as well as mental. Although each shot is different, there are repeatable elements. I want the act of hitting the ball to be physically sustainable, because I’d like to be able to play this game for the rest of my life.\nMy golf shots are constrained by my body’s structure and biometrics. These have changed over the 5 years I’ve been playing and they continue to change. Noticing feedback loops while practising and playing is a vital part of learning and improving. Golf is all about the long term. Goals, and therefore incentives, are difficult to pin down. You can’t play perfect golf, it’s all about building up to making the best choice and movement for any given spatial and temporal moment.\nLowering the cost of failure Westenberg says “a well-built system doesn’t need to be brilliant today”, it just needs “to keep working”. Although a system can’t “guarantee success”, it does “lower the cost of failure”. By building a system your wins are less about “doing something heroic once” and more about being consistently average.\nThis might sound rather boring and negative, but golf involves a great deal of luck as well as skill, something that shouldn’t be overlooked when we applaud a hero shot. A spark of brilliance isn’t something you can prepare in advance, but average consistency is attainable through diligent practice.\nBuilding a system for consistency won’t take the frustration out of golf. You’ll still miss shots spectacularly from time to time and get really irritated. But, being able to return to your system for the next shot? Well, that could make all the difference to how the game ends.\n","description":"I think Joan Westenberg's argument about backing systems over sparks is a great way to understand golf and how to improve one's game...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"Build systems","uri":"/post/2025/may/build-systems/"},{"content":"Just another week, with a lot of considering, not that much doing, but some good talking time…\n…with D and G.\nReading: Still re-reading The Traveler’s Gate Trilogy by Will Wight, which I am enjoying a lot.

I could tell that writing these notes (and sharing them with my coach) is helpful. We had a few things to discuss and then we spent some time on the range to (amongst other swing-related things) learn some strategies for how to manage myself and practice in that space, while also building some positive memories. (Given what happened the week before that was important.)\nThings to think about: I should have written about this last week! Here’s what I remember most clearly from our chat and the practice that followed on the day:\nIt is vital to set the body up properly and this is something I regularly don’t do carefully enough (in particular as I get tired, frazzled, hurried or down on myself). This is a bit difficult to explain in words (although I know what it feels like). Broadly, it’s about extending the spine, increasing space under the rib cage, while keeping the neck and head tall and in balance. I’ve been finding that if I follow my club placement process fully (see the checklists below) then I stretch and balance myself automatically. If I don’t, then I forget to think about how I’m standing. Hence - process is everything!\nOn the range (given time) work through the clubs and swing lengths. Always begin with your wedge. Then work up through longer clubs. In the lesson I worked from a putting stroke, via chipping, pitching and then full swing with all the clubs we picked.\nAllow your head and shoulders to tilt and balance your backswing. Here’s where it’s important to realise that keeping an eye on the ball and your body in the shot (see below) doesn’t mean you need to keep your head and shoulders still in terms of tilt. While you don’t want to sway, you do need to execute a spiral twist: up, back down, then through.\nYour arms will need to bend to allow the swing to work. There’s an element of keeping your arms extended through the swing, but it just doesn’t work if you try to lock your elbows. I try not to think about this at all, aiming simply to swing in a relaxed rhythm. Of course, I don’t always get this right, but overall I’m trying to be focused on relaxing and breathing before swinging easy. Tightness in my neck, shoulders and arms becomes an issue when my practice isn’t going well, making it worse. During a round I’ll get tight when I’m beginning to wonder what’s going wrong (again, the tightness will just make it worse). Sticking with the process and taking a breath helps reduce tightness and return to the rhythm I need.\nTwo weeks of issues with practice After the lesson I found I still didn’t want to visit the driving range. My motivation was derailed. When I went to practice my short game (as a compromise with myself) even that didn’t go well.\nI played ok competition golf, but there was a lot of scrambling to make up for a lot of poor shots. Then I tripped and bruised my hand, so I had a good excuse not to practice for a bit.\nThe next week I went back to working on my short game for a brief session before a pairs competition the next day (for which the result was better than our play deserved). I skipped my next practice session - motivation was low!\nI tried some on course practice on my own at the weekend, but it didn’t go well… then I took D with me, and things got a bit more enjoyable! D noticed how much better I played when I stayed in the shot, versus looking for the result. I was determined to take this insight with me into my next practice session.\nAn additional thing to think about: Stay in the shot. Ok, so, the old saying - keep your head still - is counterproductive (as I note above); but not looking up too quickly to see what’s happened to the ball in flight helps you stay in the shot, keeping your eyes on, and your body over, the ball a little longer. This (and I can confirm from personal experience now) makes for better strike, direction and distance control. It’s only a moment - a golf swing is quick - but completing the action before looking for the result is key. I find this particularly difficult on driving ranges, where I feel the need to look quickly in case it’s gone wrong directionally speaking and I need to shout a warning. The trouble is that looking up too soon makes it go wrong (often).\nI sometimes look too soon on course too, in particular when I’ve been a bit wayward already, the sun is low and/or there’s noone else to watch where I’ve gone (or I’m getting the sense people with me might not be looking).\nA week of more positive experiences When I turned up to practice the next time I went straight to the range. Everything was so much better than the previous week! I was focused on being in the shot. I was hitting things more solidly and more often in the right direction.\nI was going to do some short game work when I bumped into my coach. This resulted in more range balls and a great short lesson (for free)! Some of our time was spent improving how I hit my 28-degree hybrid (up to now my mystery club, because I never knew when to use it). The major takeaway…\nAnother additional thing to think about (!): Check the club face orientation pointing towards your target. After you’ve setup to take a shot, lift the club and turn towards your target (relaxed arms holding the club just ahead of you pointing in the direction you want the ball to go). How is the club face oriented? Mine is sometimes (and it used to be always) closed - ie tipped left - and I want it to be vertical. Adjust the handle as required - ie move the club handle in your grip, don’t twist yourself to make it look right (!!) - return to address the ball and take your shot (without changing anything else). Probably not the best explanation, but I’ve got this working pretty well now I’ve managed to incorporate it into my process. Process is everything The day after my not-a-lesson (wasn’t that a lesson?) I played an ok round of golf. Some bad shots, some really excellent ones, more scrambling to make a score. My 28-degree hybrid suddenly made sense! I hadn’t incorporated what I’d learnt into my process effectively enough - sometimes I got it, but other times I lost it.\nMy next practice session was somewhat the same, because I hit about half a large bucket of balls before I remembered to stay in the shot…! I forgot other things too! I regrouped and worked on a process that I could use for practice and also take out to the course.\nGiven I seem to forget to do things while practising and playing I’ve written myself some checklists. I can review these before I practice or play… maybe they’ll help!\nRange checklist: Work from wedge up. Do not skip the wedge!\nCheck target, choose alignment point in front of ball.\nSetup:\nUse right hand to hold the club, hand over the handle, index finger pointing down the grip Extend back and ribcage with balanced shoulders, neck and head Align the club face with alignment point Grip the club Comfortable foot position Lift and move the club face towards the target to check orientation, adjust grip if necessary Return to address the ball (Note: I find that using my right hand as described above to setup immediately means I begin to extend my back etc, I don’t know why.)\nSwing!\nAllow your head to move as a counterbalance to the swing.\nKeep your eye on the ball, look but not too soon.\nTrust the process.\nTrust your swing.\nPay attention and consider a PAD analysis.\nIssues? Work from chip via pitch to full shot for each club.\nCourse checklist: Check target, choose alignment point in front of ball (consider how lie will affect the shot).\nPractice swing (similar lie to ball).\nSetup:\nUse right hand to hold the club, hand over the handle, index finger pointing down the grip Extend back and ribcage with balanced shoulders, neck and head Align the club face with alignment point Grip the club Comfortable foot position (again, consider lie and angle) Lift and move the club face towards the target to check orientation, adjust grip if necessary Return to address the ball Swing!\nAllow your head to move as a counterbalance to the swing.\nKeep your eye on the ball, look but not too soon.\nTrust the process.\nTrust your swing.\nNext shot!\nAnzac Memorial Runner-up All power to the person that won! We had just been discussing our difficulties with golf earlier in the week, so I’m very pleased we both played to our handicaps. She pipped me to the win on a countback.\nMy process was excellent. I had some mishits, which is to be expected as I keep working with my new grip and the way it makes my swing feel. Each time I hit a poor shot I rallied and recovered well. My chips and pitches were very good. My driving was good (most of the way around). My putting was solid.\nI’ve got some time to keep working on all this before my next lesson - but not much time!\n","description":"Just over three weeks since my last golf update (other than mentions in weeknotes)...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"Process is everything","uri":"/post/2025/apr/process-is-everything/"},{"content":"Filling in medical forms drains my energy as does playing trash golf, but my attempts to do things (whatever they might be) continue…\n…while I’ve not implemented the block method from How to Do Things I have identified a few things I’d like to do in the next few months.\nReading: I am re-reading The Traveler’s Gate Trilogy by Will Wight for fun. I also bought, am reading and considering the usefulness of, Your Worry Makes Sense by Dr Martin Brunet.\nGolf: The bruise on the heel of my left hand took a while to resolve. No practice until Tuesday when I did an hour of chipping (and it went very well). Wednesday’s competition was a pairs event, Canadian Foursomes, where you both drive and then pick the ball you will continue to play alternate shots for to complete the hole. My partner and I oscillated between great and truly awful shots all round. We were three holes from the end when I finally had to announce that I’d got irritated - I just couldn’t take the trash golf I was playing any more! We finished up though, and apparently everyone else was having issues because we came third (joint second, third on a count back, which is how these things work).\nI couldn’t face practising on Thursday, so gave it a miss. No golf Friday (Good Friday). My Sunday practice on course was terrible. Not sure where my game has gone, but I expect if I just relax and have fun it’ll come back. That is how it goes -shrug-.\nExercise: Physio was good. I managed a whole 12 minutes of home weights on Saturday, which given my motivation level this week was excellent. The bulgarian split squats always hit the mark - ie I ache the day after in what is presumably a good way - so I really need to be doing these every week.\nI went for a run on Sunday morning. Woot!\nFood: We did ok this week. I cooked things (including vegetables). We ate things (including vegetables). I went out and left D at home with something I prepared earlier (ie from the freezer). He’s perfectly capable of cooking, but this was a perfect meal for one that was left over.\nGarden: I looked at the garden, but, unlike keen gardeners on long weekends, I was not inspired to do anything. You know what How to do Things says about inspiration? Don’t wait for it. There’s a lesson there somewhere… hence I need to implement the block method for some things I would like to do in the garden (divided up into specific tasks).\nAdventure: I went out to dinner somewhere new with my golf buddies. That’s an adventure for me and the food was excellent.\nSewing: I went back to the two pairs of Chandler Trousers I made ages ago (two years?). Neither pair fit at all well anymore. They weren’t that well made or fitted to begin with, to be honest, and I have changed shape since then (with weights etc). I was never that happy with the tapered leg shape of the pattern. They always felt like clown trousers to me (it’s just a me thing, I think). The green pair were so large that I experimented with reshaping them to a straighter leg. I think that’ll work for them and for me, so I’m going to alter the pattern before making another pair more carefully (slowly) with some of the nicer linen I bought from Potter \u0026 Co. I bought that material for a skirt, but they sold the fabric by the metre and it turns out I ended up with enough to make these trousers (at least I hope I have, if I’m careful)!\nThree ideas: Keep going with well-organised golf practice Try out the block method on something I’d like to do Work on managing my worries (just a little better would be a good start) I organised the other appointment and got that out of the way. I also went back into work for lunch with someone I missed last time without getting as discombobulated as the last time I went there.

I’ve been a reader of David’s blog, Raptitude, for many years. My favourite post, How to Get Yourself to Do Things, offers a great explanation of procrastination, overwhelm and the hellzone. These are things I have experienced many times and, now I’m trying to enjoy non-work life, they are things I’d like to avoid while also getting the things I really want to do done!\nI’ve just finished The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow, which I thought was a great read. I’m not sure what’s next fiction-wise. I might end up re-reading something again.\nGolf: I had another lesson this week, which I haven’t yet written up here, because I’ve struggled to try out the things I learnt. In part, my lesson was about how to set myself up to have better sessions on the driving range, sessions that are helpful to improving my game rather than being demoralising.\nAfter the lesson and on Thursday I found practice difficult for some reason. I seemed to have lost my rhythm a bit. Thursday I had planned to put the instructions from my coach into practice on the range, but when I found out I couldn’t even make good contact with my short shots I just concentrated on those and then some putting instead. I didn’t want another negative range experience like the last one (more on that at the link above)!\nI played two competitions this week. My play was fine, but nowhere near as good as Friday last week. On Wednesday I couldn’t putt, but the rest of my golf was mostly ok. On Friday a lot of my shots into greens were not good at all, but I could putt. It all evened out into ok scores, but pretty unfulfilling feels.\nI tripped over my drop foot on Friday just over half way around and bruised the heel of my left hand when I went down. That made the rest of the round quite difficult (although I managed once my brain realised it should dial down the pain because I was ignoring it). I’m resting my hand until Tuesday now, because its fine, but too uncomfortable to grip clubs properly (and therefore to practice all the things I’ve been taking the time to learn recently).\nExercise: Physio went well. I didn’t do an extra weights session because of that bruised hand (which is a crap excuse, because there were lots of things I could have done still, but I just didn’t want to). I did some extra walking this week though.\nFood: We did ok this week. I cooked a nice prawn, tomato, chilli and sour cream sauce for pasta, which I’ll make again. I did chicken and vegetables in the oven too, which is always good (and so easy).\nGarden: There was a lack of activity in the garden. I think I’m trying to motivate myself to begin choosing and planting things now (which is most people’s favourite thing, but for some reason I’m finding it difficult to make plans let alone do the work)!\nAdventure: Nope. Unless you count a trip into work to catch up with people?!\nSewing: Also nope.\nThree ideas: I think you can see why I’m trying to find ways to help motivate me to do a bit more with my time (see above).\nKeep practicing golf Organise the remaining appointment Do some planning and try out the block method on something I’d like to do I organised one of the appointments I needed to organise (the most difficult one).

Harrow.\nGolf: I’ve written a fair bit about golf recently, so all I need to say here is that I’ve been practising a lot and played the usual two competitions this week.\nExercise: Physio went well (as usual). I’ve walked on the golf course, but not elsewhere this week. I did do a home weights session, which I really did not want to do at all, so good on me for completing even the fairly short session I managed! Keeping the momentum with weights is my main exercise focus at the moment. I could have got a run in too, I expect, but only Sunday. There was too much wind this week, and too much smoke on Thursday to run.\nFood: This was a better week for food. We used up the leftover yellow split pea and coconut curry from the freezer with a bit of extra chicken. D did poached eggs on toast, with baked beans for him (one of our favourite simple meals). I cooked a baked fetta sauce to have with pasta, which was ok, but (for various reasons) not quite as chill to cook as I was hoping. I also put together oven-cooked pork and fennel sausages with apple, carrot and potato.\nCooler weather means it’s finally time to get away from salad and barbecue.\nGarden: I did some tidying out back, which was just picking at things and making sure we can walk past things easily. Out the front I was collecting leaves (now they’re coming off the trees) but decided I’d use them for mulch as they are, rather than throwing them in the green bin. I watered all the outside plants that need this, including the balcony plants. I filled the bird baths too.\nI’m beginning to read up on things I can grow to eat in the garden. For some reason I’m focused on ginger and lemongrass at the moment! I feel like I can start to plan some planting of various things now the hot weather is passing.

After moving to the other practice area for some chipping in the zone (pictured above), I returned to hit another bucket of range balls a little better.\nMy Thursday practice though was dire. I actually gave in and left some range balls for the next person, because I just couldn’t hit them clean or in the right direction. I mostly pulled things left, but overcorrecting (grip, in particular, but who knows what I was doing in the end???) meant I started to scull them right as well. It was horrible. Upsetting. Embarassing. It was time to stop and do something more positive.\nThursday shocked me a bit, because I played ok on Wednesday in the competition. It took a lot of effort to scramble a score at times, but I managed! I didn’t wipe (ie not score points on) any hole. I have documented the whole round as personal notes for myself, with a brief analysis of each shot, good and… not so good. (I doubt I’ll share the notes here because that’s too much for anyone else to take, I think.)\nManaging practice for positivity: So… what did I do on Thursday? I could have just gone home and cried (seriously, I was a bit tired and pretty upset as I left those balls behind), but instead I went back to the zone to chip and pitch my way to something better.\nAs soon as I was there things improved. I could hit the ball again with a shorter backswing. My setup was rock solid. My interlock grip was working fine. I had the club in my fingers (not palms). I didn’t exaggerate the cover position of my right hand, but I made sure it was not under, but side-over at least.\nI could hit balls to all three target pins in the chipping zone. I felt that I was still pulling the longer shots left though. There was now a side wind, pushing the ball there, but I could still feel the difference between shots I was hitting straight and the pulls. The practice session began to get… err… less than positive again.\nUsing the chipping zone differently for better focus and feedback Although the chipping zone is designed to offer three targets at different distances, today my focus was on hitting the longer shots straight. I seemed to be finding it difficult to judge what was going on with my aim and the result of each shot, so I switched-up how I used the pins.\nInstead of aiming at one, I used two pins as goal posts (the orange circle in the image above highlights two of the pins, although this photograph is from a different angle of attack than the one I was using).\nThis was really helpful. The aimpoint became a bit wider, but I was very clear on what I was trying to do. Practice got more fun. I was playing a game where I tried to hit as many goals as I could. These still aren’t full shots, but they are about 40m with my 56 degree wedge, so, erm, about 2/3rds of a full shot (ish). That’s enough for my hands and body to feel the new grip’s effect as I move from address, through back swing, impact and follow through.\nI hit so many balls. Just small batches of around 10-12 max, with a walk to collect them in between. It was quiet (only about one or two other people around). I finally stopped when I hit 6 goals from 6 balls. That seemed positive enough to end the session.\nAnalysing what went wrong on the driving range: As I drove home I also thought about why the driving range had been so difficult for me, because there were mitigating factors that it’s worth taking seriously:\nThere was a strong head wind (gusty easterly), which was offputting and accentuated anything I did wrong (assisting the flight of balls off to the left for me in particular). The bays were positioned high and back today, so I was looking down onto the range from higher up than Tuesday, from a viewpoint that tends to promote the lefts in people with that tendency unless they look up to visualise their line higher. I wasn’t looking up! I was quickly demoralised, looking down the range and despairing as I just couldn’t hit anything well or at all straight. Someone I knew was there, plus two of the other coaches (ie not mine), so I quickly tightened up as I mishit so many balls (even when I just tried to chip/pitch without a full swing). The worse it got, I’m guessing, the more slumped I got. I also think I was so scared of hitting wayward balls that in the end I wasn’t really swinging freely at all. I was stopping the follow through in particular, just hoping not to have sent the ball somewhere… bad. Look. There are things I could probably have done to improve matters. I did check my grip all the time. In the end I was probably exaggerating the cover position of my right hand too much. I tried to balance myself and stand up straighter, but it didn’t help and I wasn’t in the right headspace to persevere.\nThe driving range is usually ok when I’m having a lesson. My coach is there to see what I’m doing, reset the basics, keep me calm, get me to try things (sometimes silly things) that are helpful. On my own, well, it’s sometimes a different story.\nMoving forward: Before Friday competition play I am not going anywhere near the driving range! I will try to make time to hit a few chips/pitches though, because that will help dial in my setup and my grip. Then I’ll do some putting practice (and I’ve got a focus game for that too, which has really helped me feel like my time with the putter is well spent, more on that another time).\nWhen I’m on course I’m going to keep it simple. Make sure the handle of each club is in my fingers, with my right hand comfortable as coverside as it can be, but not over exaggerated. I’m going to be positive about each shot - stand up, get my balance, go through my setup, hit the ball with intent - and then work with whatever the result.\nCompetition update (Friday 4 April) My plan worked so well!\nAfter a driving range disaster like Thursday it can be difficult to feel confident playing a competition round, but staying away from the range for my warmup and concentrating on getting my rhythm chipping, pitching and putting on Friday was an excellent idea.\nWon the competition with 39 Stableford points (so played 3 shots better than my handicap). Best round of the year (in fact, best round of the last 6 months).\nStayed focused on shots, relaxed between shots, and made good course management decisions all round. The whole of my game was good, from tee to hole, in spite of the howling easterly. Used lower white tees for driving because of the wind, and that might be something I stick with for all my rounds for now. I was still hitting good, well-flighted shots, but without the big misses I’ve been getting with the higher blue tees in recent weeks (and a couple of times today when I tried them out).\n","description":"I've continued to practice diligently, but with varied success...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"Managing practice for positivity","uri":"/post/2025/apr/managing-practice-for-positivity/"},{"content":"I admit it. I didn’t want to write these weeknotes…\n…but keeping them going still seems useful. This week has been hot, with easterly winds of the type that have the potential to dry my eyes out so they burn. I’ve avoided being outside for too long - so no golf competition play for me. It has been a health anxiety week for a few reasons, something I really hate but seem increasingly prone to as I get older. Taking action next week to alleviate the stress and get checked out.\nThe heat and anxiety has meant a lot of sudoku this week, with Good Sudoku being my go to app for that (and it has helped me learn new techniques for solving difficult puzzles in the last few months). The image for this week gives some idea of the interface for Good Sudoku (with various cues to see patterns in some modes of play).\nReading: Having really enjoyed re-reading one of the Rivers of London series I finished and moved straight into another. I have no idea what I’m going to read next.\nGolf: This week I’ve practiced when possible and had another lesson (so ended up with new stuff to practice from that alongside the existing things). It felt too hot for competition golf (and I was not feeling 100% towards the end of the week). Maybe missing the comps was good, since changing my grip has, as was to be expected, caused a few issues (that’s an English person’s understatement of the facts, incidentally).\nMy last practice session began abysmally, with an inability to hit the small ball first (the big ball being the earth, the one you always want to hit second). When I did hit the ball it mostly shot left with the occasional ping to the right. About two shots went straight, but I wasn’t convinced!\nI went back to chipping practice with my new grip to try to find the ball and the ground again. This did work, because when I returned to full shots I hit a whole set of good ones, before skinnying a low running shot right and almost through the fence to the other golf course. That was what I had deemed to be “my last ball” of the practice, so I got another one out so as not to end on such a poor note before heading home.\nExercise: Physio was good and I managed a home weights session when I realised that it was Saturday and not Sunday. (With no golf comps I really lose track of the days.) I did 25 minutes, which was 3 times around my circuit after the warm up exercises. It was a great effort for someone who did not want to do anything at all and just goes to show that I’m actually feeling pretty fit (when I make myself move).\nI think I’d be feeling a lot better if I’d managed to get out walking too, but the weather was not conducive.\nFood: This was an odd week for food, because feeling a bit unwell meant I fasted most of one day (with no appetite) and then ate light after that. The heat meant we were back to barbecues and salad (and I’ve reached the point where I am over that, just wanting to cook something, ie anything, else).\nGarden: I did wash the bird baths and filled them, but failed to keep them topped up through all the hot days. Cut back the variegated ivy which is eating the fence and trying to get a hold on next door’s back shed. It is a monster.\nAdventure: No adventure this week.\nSewing: No sewing this week (and not much thinking about it even).\nThree ideas: Keep practicing golf Find a new book I want to read Take some breaths and try to stay calm Work’s been emailing re PhD supervisions that I thought had been sorted, so I just need to reply to those questions.\n","description":"I admit it. I didn't want to write these weeknotes...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 24 - 30 March 2025","uri":"/post/2025/mar/weeknotes-30/"},{"content":"Continued regular practice chipping/pitching meant that, once again, I could move on to something new with my third golf lesson…\n…and, don’t get me wrong, changing my grip is an important part of this journey, but it’s so weird that during the back swing it feels like hitting the ball is a physical impossibility, except it then turns out it’s not (mostly).\nThe image above shows the old and the new (ish). If you’re not a golfer you might not see that much difference, but omg it feels different, in particular as I move the club back. Looking myself I can see that we made some other small chances as the lesson evolved (but these images are stills taken from videos early and later on).\nNote - this is a personalised process for me: There’s a lot written about what constitutes a good grip. There are rules (or preferences at least) that many people follow. Just take a look around the web! However, I’m lucky because I can take a personalised approach. My coach focuses on working with you and your body’s specificities to help you hit the ball effectively in a variety of circumstances (because you’re not always on a flat grassy lie on course, you might want a straight shot, but you might not, etc). What follows is therefore what works for me, and a little about how I think it works for me (not all of which will be that well explained, I expect)!\nWorking out the grip: At the beginning of my lesson we checked what part of my hands I use to grip with (ie to grip anything, a bucket handle, for example). Our focus was on my right hand this time. The answer is that I automatically use the second joint of my fingers (ie in the middle of my fingers, not palm and not tips). We’ve done this before, but it’s always worth doing again and the check itself is helpful in reminding the hand how best to hold the weight of the club.\nGiven this grip point, the fact that I have sometimes (not always, but it’s quite often ended up like this, I think) been holding the handle of the club more towards the middle of my hand is causing issues. I drop my right shoulder as I take this heavier grip and this means I tend to hit the ground before the ball. It also reduces my ability to hinge my hands with the weight of the club in balance.\nAdopting more of a palm grip moves the right hand to a side/under position on the handle for me, so that, although I might start with my clubface square to the target (left image below), as I swing I tend to close the club face (right image below). This makes the ball go left - my classic pull miss shot! Not surprising at all.\nMoving my right hand on the club to take more of a top, known as cover, position makes a big difference to how the club face moves through my swing, so I hit the ball with face square to the target line much more easily. Of course, I also have to move my left hand a bit to accommodate the right’s new position (and since that weakens my left hand’s effect on the club face’s movement, this also reduces the chances of a pull to the left).\nThe effect of these small changes is to make things feel really weird to me. It takes a bit of practice time to bed this sort of change in so it becomes more comfortable and easier to achieve consistently.\nInitial practice and feelings After my lesson I carried on hitting balls for a while. It all felt strange. It didn’t always work. It turned out that I also need to consider my elbow position at address too, because as I try to ease the new weird feel of my swing I think I’m using my elbow to cheat the feel back to more normal. This closes the club face - I was checking what happened each time I sent a shot straight and each time it went left, so I’m pretty sure about what was happening most of the time.\nAfter I left, and later in the evening, I realised that the middle and ring fingers of my left hand were sore. The grip change definitely had an effect, and my left hand was not that happy.\nNext day’s practice From past experience, it’s worth putting in some extra time at this point to keep the changes you’re making intact, while also working out any little tweaks… I’m hitting a lot of balls, so that is making my body sore, but I think I can also tell if anything can be done to make things more comfortable long term.\nIt was when I started hitting wedges as a warm up that I realised just how unhappy those fingers of my left hand felt. I changed my glove to see if it made any difference, and there was a slight improvement. I took some time to feel the grip as a whole - how balanced was the club in my hand, how was the wrist hinge feeling. I felt that my hands weren’t as well connected as they had been feeling before moving the handle up more into my fingers (away from my palm). The new grip made it feel like the handle could slip around a little, a gap sometimes formed between fingers of left and right hands too. It felt like I might be gripping hard with my left hand fingers, harder than last week, to maintain a sense of control (which might be a misplaced attempt, but that’s what was happening).\nA few years ago I moved to a baseball, or ten finger, grip to stop twisting my little finger in the interlock grip I first adopted when I took up golf. However, I can see how the ten finger grip might exacerbate the issues I have with positioning the club handle in my hands, since when I imagine how I would hold a bat, as opposed to a golf club, I can see how the handle might have moved more towards my palm quite naturally. I can even see how this might happen when looking at the images of the three types of golf grip here.\nI’ve not tried an interlock grip for at least 3 years, but when I tried it out again today it felt ok. My hands are stronger than they were from nearly two years of heavy weights, hanging exercises and attempted pullups (recovery for my ACL injury as well as attempting to avoid osteoporosis). The interlock position helped my grip feel more solid, reduced the tension in my left hand, and reinforced the finger position of the handle and right hand cover grip position.\nI moved from ten finger to interlock a few times during practice. I think interlock may be best moving forwards, but I’ll keep an open mind until I have a few more sessions completed (to see how my hands feel as well as how the swing is working).\nI did find I had a touch of the lefts in my second practice session. I need to constantly check my grip and watch my elbow position at address when setting my grip. There’s a lot to consider (although you have to get to the stage where you’re not thinking, just swinging the club, at some point).\nMoving ahead and considering the setup process: Changing my grip has a knock on effect on my setup process. My process has been well-honed by consistent practice over the last two weeks, but now I need to incorporate recent changes. Here’s some early thinking (based on what I practiced most recently):\nContinue to set the club into position with the right hand, thinking about target line, face direction and handle position in line with inner right hip and up to right collarbone BUT the right hand is now holding the club differently, less side under and more covering the handle Once the club head is positioned as you’ve taken a stance, loosen the right hand to allow the left to slip into the grip, interlock or not, the idea being to keep the right hand position while fitting the left hand below in a comfortable way Swing the club (and try not to get put off by how strange it feels!! Issues??\nCheck that elbow too! It’s all a bit up in the air for now… I need to keep practicing to make the swing that results from the altered grip feel flowing and comfortable. The swing itself looks similar from the outside (I have the video evidence), but feels different to me… very different.\n","description":"Continued regular practice chipping/pitching meant that, once again, I could move on to something new with my third golf lesson...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"Aaargh grip change","uri":"/post/2025/mar/aaargh-grip-change/"},{"content":"I’ve had a few conversations in the last week or so, most recently with my golf coach, which have made me think about goals…\n…in relation to golf and life more generally.\nThe goal in a game of golf might seem pretty clear - get the ball in the hole in as few shots as possible (see above image of a ball next to the par 4 15th hole, no doubt in my image library because I was there for two shots, ie putting for birdie, but luckily I can’t remember if I made that putt and it was certainly a practice round because I took the time to make a video as I walked up the green)!\nHowever, as my coach and I dicussed this morning, this sort of goal, which can also be thought of in terms of competition scores or bringing in one’s handicap, while simple and sometimes useful, can also be counterproductive. I’ve had more then one conversation that has touched on the idea of goals this week, so what I’ve been thinking about today applies as much to life more generally as golf in particular.\nDestinations and goals, versus journeys and processes: A couple of quick and dirty web searches (using DuckDuckGo, not Google, because I’m avoiding AI search, although the sites I find are increasingly poorly written and repetitive, thus making my Gen AI warning alarm sound) give me the sense that a focus on journeys or processes, rather than destinations and goals, is quite often linked with religion, maybe most often Zen Buddhism (although not exclusively).\nA more secular viewpoint can be articulated, purely around the way that defining a goal sets an end point, while driving home the idea that this is something you don’t have, or somewhere you haven’t reached. Once it’s attained you will need to decide on a new goal (if you want to keep moving). But what do you have and where are you now? Appreciating these things is always important.\nFrom a personal perspective, I increasingly find myself setting aside fixed goals to focus on dynamic processes, with much more interest now on body and feel, rather than mind and thinking (or overthinking, at least). I’m finding this hard to write (although I do want to work through the ideas here), because I’m having to think too hard!\nWork goals (and the difficulty with work processes): One of the reasons I left my academic job was because I found both the goals and processes involved stressful and, often, de-motivating as opposed to motivating let alone sparking joy.\nMost of my problems began with research - since I found the research writing process difficult from my time as a PhD student on. At least I was happy with the results of my writing struggles, and I’m glad to have a complete record on this site of all my publications (along with an archive of the final published versions so I can share these with anyone who is interested to read). The recent (ie in the last few years) move away from publication measures to proving and measuring research engagament and recently was a new game I never felt equipped to play.\nTeaching began as something I really enjoyed, in particular face-to-face, but this changed over the years. Covid moved things even more online than they already were, with only a partial return to face-to-face teaching. The rise of Generative AI introduced new questions around how university education worked. I’m so concerned with the environmental impacts of these technologies that I found it impossible to embrace them in any easy way (even as I was trying to help students recognise how to use such technologies in the best, ethical ways).\nIn terms of teaching and goals… well, feelings of accomplishment were mostly lacking. Institutional quantitative and qualitative surveys are known to be flawed. Academics all fall into the trap of reading over many positive, to focus on a few negative, evaluations. I do have some letters, cards and emails from students directly thanking me for my work. These provide the best and most valuable commentary on my time as a lecturer and supervisor.\nWhat are my golf goals (or are they not goals)? I might say I want to enjoy hitting satisfying shots, without worrying overly about scores and handicaps, but what does this really mean? Does this mean high scores on all aspects of a PAD analysis? I think it is probably less tangible, more to do with the feel of the shot (wherever it goes).\nMaybe, it is about the game in a broader sense? While a single shot can be satisfying, it’s stringing a few together that really hits the spot. Maybe a good, or great, set of shots to complete a hole is the goal (as many times as possible in a round)?\nThe attempt to set aside goals, as limited and less helpful than they seem, may mean that it’s the process of playing that is the key.\nIt might be best to concentrate on the feeling of the process. Appreciating where you are now, how you would like the game to feel, moving towards that feeling, and in the process playing better golf?\nIs this too vague? Probably.\n","description":"I've had a few conversations in the last week or so, most recently with my golf coach, which have made me think about goals...","tags":["Golf","Life","Identity"],"title":"Golf and goals","uri":"/post/2025/mar/golf-and-goals/"},{"content":"Took no proper photos this week, so here’s a really bad one of the river and ocean view through the gap between houses…\n…for a week where I caught up with people I’d not seen for months and years respectively, while not looking forward to the return of summer temperatures in a few days time.\nReading: I mostly didn’t enjoy The Terminal Experiment but I did finish it (and it improved towards the end, I think). I’m re-reading one of the Rivers of London series at the moment (pure comfort reading, but also because a new one is on its way later this year). I love this series.\nGolf: I rested Monday (after the Sunday competition), practiced on Tuesday and played well on Wednesday. By the time I got to Friday I’d completely lost it again! It was all made worse by our group falling behind the group in front, because speeding up our play did not help the difficulty I was already having in finding my rhythm. I bailed out of thinking about the score on the 18th as I just tried to re-learn how to hit my hybrid from rough sandy lies (repeatedly and without success).\nRemember me saying I need to keep better notes on what went well? Well, that hasn’t really happened! I did hit some nice shots and putted well on some holes but abysmally on others. I’m not sure how to get better at recording what I’ve done, because in competitions there is a lot to think about already.\nI have a lesson in the heat on Tuesday next week (probably 34 degrees, which could be worse, but not much). Hope I survive! Then I might not play on Wednesday because it is so hot (forecast for 35 degrees atm), returning when its just a bit hot on Friday (maybe around 33 degrees).\nI was really enjoying the cooler temperatures in the morning, so I hope they return sometime soon!\nExercise: Physio was good again and I did 20 minutes of home weights on Saturday, which was a good effort because I really didn’t want to get started at all.\nI walked a bit, due to meeting up at the river with people (separately, at different parts of the river) I’d not seen in years. Trying to wear in my new walking sandals the second time, so now I have huge blisters (even though they are exactly the same style as my old ones).\nFood: We dined on some of the cooking I did previously this week, as well as a few new things. Made it through a huge pack of green beans, so the continued effort to eat more vegetables is going ok. Neither of us felt that well this week (on different days). Although it wasn’t that hot, we may well have both felt the after effects of too much sun playing golf.\nGarden: We did nothing.\nAdventure: This week I met up with two people I’d not seen in ages. Walking, sitting and chatting was good (and much easier now I’ve stopped working, because work isn’t the only thing I’m thinking about).\nSewing: Thinking is happening, doing is not.\nThree ideas: Keep practicing golf (and write up notes from my next lesson, since it’ll be too hot to practice that much this week) Wash the bird baths and make sure they’re topped up all week in the heat Sew something (probably a skirt) I think I have yet another article review to turn down (but I did turn down the last one eventually).\n","description":"Took no proper photos this week, so here's a really bad one of the river and ocean view through the gap between houses...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 17 - 23 March 2025","uri":"/post/2025/mar/weeknotes-23/"},{"content":"This crow has probably seen a lot of me this week (image of the weeknote)…\n…as it flew around the golf course.\nI’m so tired that as I’m writing this I really can’t think what to say (see Golf below).\nReading: Finished the two books from T Kingfisher’s fantasy fiction series The Clocktaur War.\nNow I’m back reading more from Robert J. Sawyer. This time it’s The Terminal Experiment which I’m not enjoying that much, but probably still want to finish.\nGolf: Played a practice round of 6 holes on Monday after a chipping/pitching practice session (working on ideas from my first coaching session). I took Tuesday off and then played a pretty bad round on Wednesday, followed by more practice (because it was bad and I was blading my chips over the green).\nNow, in saying that, I have just realised that as part of my learning journey I need to keep better notes on what went well, to help deal with the feeling that it was all awful, because I know it wasn’t really.\nI had my second lesson on Thursday, where I progressed to a new part of the swing, because my diligent practice over the week meant I really had managed to embed the first lesson’s ideas into what I was doing (even if I wasn’t always managing to put it into practice in a competition).\nThe Friday competition score was much better (and I did hit the ball well). Then there was a big competition on Sunday. I was very nervous playing with D and two blokes I’d never met, but I channelled that into my focus and process… and it worked! I scored well, with a couple of dips (the worst right at the end, because I think I was exhausted at that point having concentrated so hard all the way around).\nSo as not to flood this space with golf thinking maybe I should keep a separate log of my play… It might be easier with a little note book anyway? I have been resisting that (because I’d be embarassed to be seen taking it so seriously). Maybe I could score each hole using PAD together with a quick note on overall thoughts? I might even be able to manage that when I get home after playing.)\nExercise: Physio was good. I managed a short home weights session after golf on Friday (which did make me feel better not worse, as it often does). I didn’t do more than this, or go for a run either.\nI’ve been spending a lot of time walking and swinging clubs. I even went for a walk away from the golf course.\nFood: Cooked some really good things this week, with split peas and beans (so upping the vegetable, fibre and protein levels finally). I also managed to cook double-ish portions, so we’ve got some freezer stock now, which is always a good thing.\nGarden: I pottered around and filled half a bin with pruning, weeding and tidying in general. D pulled out a bunch more grass runners after that, so we did well!\nAdventure: Oh dear. Sorry. It’s all about golf. Oh… and sewing…\nSewing: I cut out a skirt and completed the make. Then I wore said skirt on Sunday for presentations and platters post golf. Can’t get better than that really. The skirt is a little narrow and bulky to be more generally comfortable and useful, I think, but it was good enough. If I was still working I’d wear it for that!\nMy next make might be an overshirt/jacket or another skirt. If it is a skirt then I’m going to have to alter that pattern again! Just a little more ease towards the hem (fine at the waist).\nThree ideas: Keep practicing the new golf stuff (because I’m all in with this now and need to keep momentum) Do something in the garden (because I always feel better when that’s done, even if it’s just the watering of pots, which has been lacking recently) Sew something (if there’s time) I ignored the email from the journal re reviewing an article. I’m going to respond with a no now, because I just don’t want to do the work. Sorry.\n","description":"This crow has probably seen a lot of me this week (image of the weeknote)...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 10 - 16 March 2025","uri":"/post/2025/mar/weeknotes-16/"},{"content":"Regular practice, for 5 days out of 6 after my first, meant my second golf lesson was about the follow through, along with tips for practice and analysis of progress…\n…the latter designed to keep me positive, while helping me to improve.\nThe image above is the chipping zone where I practice most of the time, with three landing areas and markers at different distances. I’m also using the area where I can chip and pitch up to the green (with a variety of flags set up), because that looks and feels more like the course itself. The practice area is excellent (so long as it’s not too busy, since not everyone obeys the rules):\nMy second lesson allowed me to check how well I’d implemented my new process, from looking and thinking, through setup and into the shot itself.\nIt can easily go wrong: The most important things I’ve been noticing sometimes as I practice, but mostly when playing a competition round, are:\nForgetting to stretch up and level myself out (what that means depends on the lie, uphill, downhill etc). The relaxed tension in the spine and balance across the head and shoulders is vital to allowing the shoulders and arms move through the swing rhythmically to make clean contact with the ball Introducing too much wrist hinge rather than keeping the hands neutral. A wrist hinge can be added, and I expect it naturally is, as the shot gets longer (just by feel for what I need to do), but it’s not needed on most short shots and is counter productive, either making for too much force and therefore length on the shot, or missed ball contact (chunk and flub or maybe a thin shot) Although I have chunked a few chips on course, my main miss has been thinning very short shots. I’m not totally sure why this is, but it’s probably to do with too much tension in arms and shoulders, looking up too soon (to see the result), a lack of rhythm in the shot and not feeling comfortable in setup.\nAll I can do is to stick with the process, accept the anxiety (because a shorter shot is no less anxiety inducing than a longer one) and carry on practising. The new focus on follow through may help with this issue too (see below).\nI do think the other thing to remember is that all this work on higher flighted chip shots (56 degree wedge for me) means I’m less comfortable with the low chip and run (8 or 9 iron) that used to be my go-to whenever possible. I can learn to do both these things, but the feel is different and I could do with more practice moving from one to the other. On some lies and flag positions the low chip and run is still easier for me to visualise and execute (with good results).\nNew process/shot goals: Continue to work the process up to and through setup and into the shot Now think about providing the required centripetal force to control the follow through. Aim to keep club handle closer to the body and under control with club head in a balanced position, so as not to be pulled out of balance (retaining a balanced feeling is how that weird visual of placing the club in a hip holster after a shot comes about) Finish tall, facing the target (ish), gluteal muscles in tension, knees together, all in balance so the arms can relax Things to watch: Allow the right heel to lift as you follow through! Because when I’m aiming for a position with tension in some of my body I can forget to allow other things to move (this particualar one leading to a sore back with too much arch) Things to try: If you lose the feel/it feels awful:\nUse right hand only to setup Take some right-handed swings (with/without hitting balls) It’s much easier to setup and to feel when and where things are out of balance at any point with just one hand on the club! This won’t really work with the new follow through focus completely (I think), but it should help get things back on track for more practice.\nRhythm is everything - imagine it, then do it Implement PAD analysis: P is for Process. How well did you run the process, from looking and thinking to taking the shot? Did you feel ready? A is for Accuracy. How close were you to the line you chose for the shot? D is for Distance. How well did you control the distance (to the carry point and/or the final resting place, because both matter and your focus might have been one or the other, and your subconcious might have picked one or the other too)? You can score each of these out of 10, but don’t forget to build a feedback sandwich. There will be some thing(s) you did well, some thing(s) to improve and you need an overall good take on the shot to finish with (since even a chunk/thin could well have been in the right direction, or maybe the shot was awful but the end result was fine).\nThinking about distance control… it might be worth getting a sense of which focus works naturally in different situations. I know I think about both aimpoints for carry and aimpoints for runout at different times on course, but where do each of these things have the best results for me?\nWhat I learnt from my first long practice session Practice is hard. I started well and then lost concentration. Something similar can happen when you’re playing too. I got hot (and that makes it easy to lose body form and mental focus). Process is important. Visualisation is important. Taking time with setup and then rhythm of movement is important. I managed to get back on track today by resetting myself and laying out out some challenges to help me stop and think over each shot.\nHaving rhythm across the swing is absolutely vital Being purposeful is vital too (and, for me, that feeling is particularly difficult to achieve the shorter the shot and the less movement is involved) Revised notes for my coach: I can’t see how you’re going to manage not to tell me why I need to do something (which is what I suggested last time)! Although it would be good to reduce my brain’s cognitive, analytical and critical load in a lesson, I don’t think it’s possible. I just need to take the hit, spend some time on the feels with some practice of my own just after, and then process the lesson later (even a few days later) as I’m doing here.\n","description":"Regular practice, for 5 days out of 6 after my first, meant my second golf lesson was about the follow through, along with tips for practice and analysis of progress...","tags":["Golf"],"title":"Continuing to learn to hit a small ball","uri":"/post/2025/mar/continuing-to-learn/"},{"content":"Finally got around to making the modified skirt for patterned materials with inset side seam pockets…\n…which was an easy make (easier than expected) and bodes well for a make with the more expensive material I bought recently!\nThe image for this post shows the full skirt, view into the side seam pocket and the pocket’s construction. This skirt was made with heavy weight fabric (strictly meant for upholstery, but I loved the pattern so bought it to make a jacket, which will still happen in the future). I realised I had enough for one of these simple skirts so went ahead and made it as a test for the inset pocket. I did make this pocket with some light weight cotton/linen as the front of the bag. That was to reduce bulk at the seam with the waistband, which I think now was essential.\nThis version is cut narrower than the first wearable toiled (also to reduce bulk). I would probably like a bit more ease in versions made with lighter weight fabric, so need to consider that when cutting material for the others I have planned. The waistband is wider than the toile too, and this is more comfortable (in particular with this heavy material).\nThe overlocker (serger) helped make the finish inside neat, although for the seams themselves I did use my sewing machine. This allowed me to follow the instructions for the inset side seam pockets, and deal with the more precise sizing I needed this time. The pockets are awesome. The way they are worked into the waistband ensures the pocket is able to take even the heaviest phone without destroying the line of the skirt. My previous post on the pattern and my first make shares the details for this pocket pattern.\nI think I might make another plain skirt next. In part this is because I’m trying to avoid re-threading the overlocker too often. It makes sense to use the white thread while I can, before switching to black for makes in dark materials!\n","description":"Finally got around to making the modified skirt for patterned materials with inset side seam pockets...","tags":["Sewing"],"title":"Patterned skirt","uri":"/post/2025/mar/patterned-skirt/"},{"content":"A long weekend here that doesn’t feel that way, with lots of golf, some music and pretty skies…\n…that are pictured above and below.

I regretted missing her last trip to Perth, so was glad to make it this time around. The music is an eclectic mix, the presentation sometimes theatrical, and it all worked very well for this venue. We lucked out with parking close to the gate, had comfortable seats and only messed up when we left our seat cushions behind (but they weren’t loved enough to warrant going back).\nReading: I’ve been reading more than usual, but feel that I’m hurrying through my last couple of choices. Maybe I do think of T Kingfisher’s fantasy fiction as easy reading (and there’s nothing wrong with that, just like easy listening, easy reading can be a great). I hadn’t realised that T Kingfisher was a pen name used by Ursula Vernon.\nI’ve got some notes for a post/posts about science fiction writing that I think helps expand thinking about AI and robots (see my last weeknote), but I want to think carefully about how to give a sense of the narratives without direct spoilers. (Is that even possible?)\nGolf: Played a practice 9 holes with D on Monday where I hit the ball really well. This was gratifying, because normally when I’m with D I play dreadful golf. Then I played pretty badly in the competition on Wednesday, followed by an awful front 9 and then very good back 9 on Friday. The howling easterly and very difficult course setup was a contributing factor in the Wednesday awfulness.\nI had already booked a lesson with my coach because I want to improve and feel a bit lost, so went to that on Friday afternoon with the result that I’m making some (big?) changes… (see last post). This could spell disaster in the short term, although it might not. I’ll just have to see how it goes.\nMy practice session on Sunday followed by a quick 6 holes with some friends indicates that if I can just relax about the changes across the whole of my game then… it might be ok (better than ok, actually). Wednesday will be the real test (and then another lesson Thursday).\nExercise: No physio session this week because of the long weekend. I managed a proper home weights session on Tuesday, which I could definitely feel on Wednesday (and that may not have helped my golf). After that though I failed to do more (in part because I was on the golf course the whole of Friday and not motivated on Saturday.

Currently I’m not even going through all these motions when I’m practising, just a partial back swing and follow through as I chip/pitch my way to success (maybe).\nOf course, when I’m playing a round I’ll still be using a full swing, so it’ll be interesting to see how the new setup and feel of my practice swing works with that! It could be good… but it could be awesomely bad. I suppose you have to expect to make a mess if you want to tidy something properly.\nProcess to remember: Occipital bones stretched up and level Know and set club face direction (ie take a line on the target and find an aim point about a metre in front of you) Lay down the club with the butt in line with right side collarbone, inner right hip Take a balanced stance (ball and club head position will change depending on club and shot type, but for now it’s a wedge so that is pretty central in the stance) Swing according to feel for carry distance to target Things to watch: Tendency will be to move butt of club forward, so watch this and reposition or reset completely if necessary Swing back and through in balance, ie let the club move easily back and forth, not falling behind you (exerting a force outside of the natural swing direction) Thumbs down (neutral hands, no flipping/twisting) Things to try: If you lose the feel/it feels awful:\nUse right hand only to place the club and align the butt with inner right hip line to right collarbone One handed (right hand) chipping for a few balls Aims: Clean strike (means you at least have some chance to finesses shots reliably to different distances) Get a feel for the natural flight and distance for the club in hand given the extent of swing and “oomph” applied I’m a “feel” player (ie I need to see things, visualise what I’m trying to do, allow my body to do what it feels it needs to do to achieve the goal).

This week we made it to one of the light and soundscape installations for Karla Bidi (the lights reaching up into the sky being pictured above). There were a series of these at different sites and I’ve now missed the opportunity to visit any more (because, as usual, I’m too late to the party).\nWe also went to the last night (!) of The Last Great Hunt’s Night Night. Innovative theatre that uses live video as part of the performance, always entertaining, sometimes a bit strange, occasionally loses you (but mostly gets you back on track by the end). It was a short performance (55 minutes) followed by indian street food at a local restaurant, Sauma, new to all of us (delicious).\nReading: Finished Robert J. Sawyer’s Starplex. Started something different (because I need a break from this particular style of science fiction almost immediately).\nI’m toying with the idea of writing a post about science fiction writing (and maybe film) that I’ve found helpful in expanding my thinking about AI and robots, because I was recently invited to be part of a panel discussion on popular culture and AI, but declined because:\nWhile SF as a whole contains some great critical and innovative representations of AI, I think that many of the commonly known pop cultural narratives are not that helpful. Overall, I feel I’m just too negative and irritable about AI, technology and the environment to contribute positively to a panel discussion for a general audience!\nThis could be a cue to share some of the “great critical and innovative representations” I like the most.\nGolf: Another morning practice session this week, which does seem to have helped. I played two competitions and overall felt a lot more comfortable this week than last. I’ve booked my first lesson with my coach with a clear plan for what I want to achieve (and questions around organising some more lessons in the coming weeks).\nExercise: I missed my home weights session and with no formal physio session next week I need to make a plan so I don’t lose momentum. I did do some pushups on a couple of occasions (and can now manage five full pushups). My pullups are still just partial (to about 30 degrees from the bottom, or up to the top from standing below our door-mounted bar).\nI went running! I signed up for the 5k February Strava challenge (because a friend had also done this) and actually went for a run. Not fast, but done.\nSince I was getting very irritable with my procrastinating self, struggling to do other things after a very active start to the week, I went for a riverside walk to cheer myself up one afternoon.\nFood: We went out twice (for thai-ish and the indian food mentioned above). We ate pretty well at home, but I think I need to raise my fibre game with vegetables/pulses.\nGarden: No garden work (other than some watering and filling bird baths) again. It wasn’t too hot all the time, I was just too lazy.\nI’m thinking of planting one of the smallest areas I have to do to try to make it fun… or maybe just easy?!\nAdventure: Unless you count a trip to the city as adventure, this week was lacking in very much of this. I don’t know… feeling too… something… to get around to that winging lesson. I hope I’ll feel more like tackling new things soon.\nSewing: This week I bought a pattern for a top, because it was almost exactly what I’ve been looking for (although maybe a bit too boxy, but that could be altered, I think).\nThere was a lot of procrastination and no actual sewing again.

The first was to begin setting up a space to link together online profiles for myself and my research. The second was to gain skills in writing for blogs and social media so I could support my students (because Web Comms was all about creating a web presence, including a website or blog and linked Web 2.0 profiles on other platforms).\nThat blog became more of a website. I did occasionally add a post and I was good at keeping my online CV up to date (updating my About information each year too), but it was too static to be called a blog really. I used the site for a couple of side projects too (serving pages of information behind the scenes).\nWhen I left my lecturing job at the end of 2024 I felt the need to start something new. Part of the reason I wanted to stop teaching people about digital and social media was because I was becoming increasingly disillusioned and annoyed by commercial platforms, yet I still needed to remain on all those platforms to support my students. It was driving me a bit mad. Now I am free! I began to investigate options to move away from Wordpress to a static site in the middle of 2024. By November last year (as I was leaving work) I’d worked out how to set myself up with what you see here. My new space is still developing, but I’m happy with how it’s working out.\nWhat platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before? This site is written in Hugo. I’ve used a template I really liked, with some small changes that were carefully programmed hacked together with the help of other people’s code. I expect it doesn’t all work perfectly and I have a lot of writing to do if I’m going to make the Collections area worth reading, but my priority has been writing here regularly, which I have achieved with the help of weeknotes.\nI picked Hugo having tried it first, switching to Jekyll and then back to Hugo during my testing of options. In part it was because of the template I found, in part it was because I stumbled upon good resources and other people’s blogs with helpful setup notes. It works pretty well with Github pages. I have a writing and publishing workflow which is clunky, but works for me. I’m much happier writing here.\nI mentioned Blogger and Wordpress above. My old blog/website was on Edublogs which uses Wordpress. That host made sense at the time (in 2009) when my site was about higher education teaching and research. The site still exists for now, but I’ll probably be taking it down later this year (or at least switching to free hosting there). The Wordpress interface was overkill for me. I just wanted to keep things simple, hence the move to a static site where I write my posts in markdown (and publish with my probably super-clunky process that I seem to find calming).\nBy moving to this new site I have freed myself up to write about whatever I want… and it turns out that for the time being at least that isn’t research (robots and AI)! At the moment I’m all about life and the things I am doing now.\nHow do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog? I write my posts in markdown using Markdown Editor written by Satoshi Iwaki on my Macbook. This is a very simple editor, but it does exactly what I want and is easy to use. I publish my site via Github pages to a URL I chose that makes sense to me, but kept costs down when purchased for the long term.\nWhen do you feel most inspired to write? Currently I am mostly movitated to keep my weeknotes streak. I’m sometimes late with a weeknote (Tuesday is the latest I’ve posted, I think, although the publish date is always a Sunday, which is the optimal writing day), but I’ve not missed one since my last week at work.\nI have written some other posts and have plans for more. I’m writing here for myself really, although some of the stuff I write might be interesting or amusing to other people. I’m not sure how this space will develop. I do know that weeknotes are a key part of my life right now. I’m finding them helpful to keep track of what I’ve been doing and what I would like to do next.\nDo you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft? Normally I publish immediately. I read things locally straight after they’re written and then just push it all to Github. I usually see something later in the day on the live site (maybe when checking how it looks on a phone, for example) that I’ll go ahead and fix if it bothers me enough. Sometimes I find ways to format something better, so I may push those fixes back into past posts if that makes sense.\nFor future longer or more critical (maybe research-related?) writing I might be more likely to pause for a break before reading what I’ve written at least once prior to publishing. All in all though this site is more about publish first, fix later!!\nWhat’s your favourite post on your blog? It’s early days… I’m happier with my weeknotes from the beginning of this year, with cue headings to structure things better. I want to write more, but I’ve been struggling to find the time in amongst all the other things I’m doing. Ask me another time!\nAny future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature? This is a new space, so there are no plans to redesign or move to another platform in the works. I just want to keep writing and occasionally tweak things as necessary. I might get rid of darkmode, since the switch to this can stuff up the comments section (and I don’t know how to fix this even having looked at a lot of technical advice and examples). Was it worth adding comments…? I’m not sure, but the site felt wrong without them.\nI have been reading about webmentions and linking with the fediverse. I’ve also read about webrings. I have not worked any of those things out yet (in terms of whether they’re for me, or how to get them working).\nWho’s next? I’m very late to the party. As I say, no-one doing this challenge knows about me (as far as I’m aware), so I took the opportunity to respond to an open call for participation! If you do read this and are blogging anywhere then please take this post as your call to action to join in.\n","description":"I'd never get tagged directly (because I'm pretty sure no-one doing the challenge knows I'm writing), but at least I can respond to the open call...","tags":["Web","Writing","Life"],"title":"The blog questions challenge","uri":"/post/2025/feb/blog-questions-challenge/"},{"content":"Art, art and there should have been more art (but the opening times didn’t work for me), lunch, beach and golf…\n…so I did well this week, but am annoyed I missed David Spencer’s Pentimento in Fremantle.\nThe cover image this week is a still from a video I took of Alice Guiness’s Burndud Ground at John Curtin Gallery (as part of the Perth Festival). The interactive light projections were great - I love playing with this sort of artwork. I also made it to Scott Price’s Radical Ecologies (now closed, but you can see these works and more on the artist’s website). I own a small piece from Scott and I’m fascinated by the materials used and the way these carry the experience of nature and the environment into the art (and to the viewer).\nReading: The story in Robert J. Sawyer’s Starplex is interesting, but some of the character development annoys me (and feels dated). I don’t mind all the technical explanations (which is what does make this “hard” science fiction, in spite of my misgivings last week).\nStill no more ruminations about New Happy. In part I think that’s because I’m not working currently, and I’m still very much in “don’t ask me to do much I’m taking a break” mode.\nGolf: Practice one morning and three rounds of competition (with the final comp being a team effort with D). I’m still pretty erratic. Practice helped with some things (I think), but my driving is still excellent, or awful, with no sense of why from one attempt to the next. I suspect that (and D confirms this is certainly possible) it’s because I’m trying to hit the ball, rather than just swinging and letting the club do the work.\nAt least my golf balls are happy:\nExercise: I did a random home weights session (no repeats, just a lot of different exercise sets). I also did pushups and attempted pullups on multiple days.\nGuess what? No running.\nFood: We ate ok at home, but the thai beef salad I had after golf was the winner for me.\nGarden: No garden work (other than some watering and filling bird baths). Too hot. Too tired from other things.\nPreparation for planting continues (in my head)! I have found some useful resources on preparing the ground.\nAdventure: No more windsurfing, although I did go down to the beach… but it was so cold. I know. I’ve been complaining about it being too hot, but then, suddenly, I was too cold and ill-prepared to go in the water.\nI went for a walk instead and took a picture of a metal seal:\nSewing: I bought a flat pack table and constructed it, so my sewing machine and overlocker have a place to be. That doesn’t mean I’ve used them there yet. I did hand sew my golf umbrella to tighten up the elastic (which holds the upper layer in place over the gust holes).\nI’m afraid that I might be sewing skirts well into winter and then not wearing them for ages… maybe if I pull the stops out I could make the really pretty one in time to wear in the next few weeks?\nThree ideas: Book that winging lesson? Check out gardening resources Make a skirt (? or plant something in the garden?) I did not send the work-related emails I was meant to send and can feel myself sliding away into flakiness (ie just not saying anything and dodging the issue until I have to reply to a direct query). Gah! I don’t like having to write those responses, so I guess I’d better send the emails today.\nI miss my work friends. I even toyed with the idea of setting up Unoffice Hours for them, but it probably wouldn’t work. It’s not the same as being in the same a corridor with an open door through which people wander when they want to chat. I wonder though? Would academics in general like to have a service where they can just complain about things for 15 minutes to someone who has enough academic background to be a sounding board?\n","description":"Art, art and there should have been more art (but the opening times didn't work for me), lunch and golf...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 17 - 23 February 2025","uri":"/post/2025/feb/weeknotes-23/"},{"content":"Not a fantastic week, with the car breaking down (and me with it, to some extent)…\n…but I’m feeling much better and the car is fixed, so things are looking up again.\nThis week’s picture is a view looking up at our tree. I’ve been thinking of writing at least one post that documents all of the tree’s inhabitants over a day. The birds often seem to have booked shifts up there, with arguments breaking out when a group overstay their timeslot. Today though (the day after I should have written this weeknote) it has been the preserve of the raven(s).\nReading: I’ve paused my re-reading of the Silo trilogy by Hugh Howey because the story has deviated from the television series quite a bit at this point. I realised I was getting confused with some characters experiencing very different lives across the two narratives. Moving on to Robert J. Sawyer’s Starplex involves a change of pace to what some people (including Sawyer) describe as “hard” science fiction (although I’m not sure I agree - maybe it depends on how you read the story and the details to which you pay attention).\nI’ve not done much more reading of New Happy. I’ve stalled a bit (as I often do on this genre of book, although, as the author says, this isn’t really traditional “self-help” since it isn’t just about helping the self alone, rather about helping the self via helping society and other people). One thing I have been trying to track is daily emotions/moods, but I’ve already discarded the resource the New Happy website offers to design my own more flexible and artistic method. I’m going to have to write a post about that once I’ve worked on it a bit more.\nGolf: Two rounds of competition, with no practice… one good and one half good (and then very bad) where good and bad is not just judged via scoring, but also by ability to hit the ball pretty much at all in the right direction. There is work to be done here, but this week was not the week to be doing that work.\nExercise: I bailed on home weights… again. I was exhausted from my over-anxious reaction to the car breaking down, organising the garage, a tow, and the repairs. It all went fine, but it rattled me when I had to drive home in limp mode (because I realised it could have been a lot more scary and dangerous if I hadn’t been on local small streets). My physio session at the gym was good though.\nAlso, still no running. I will get there eventually.\nFood: We did eat well, but I self-sabotaged by drinking wine too many nights. I didn’t have a lot, but these days it can result in less restful sleep (already put into disarray by my stress).\nGarden: Managed about a third of a bin with couch grass and a massive deceased rose bush root system.\nMy plans for the garden are developing in my head, but not in physical space! Can’t yet work out if the rocks in the back garden bird bath are really helpful, so no more rocks have been purchased yet.\nAdventure: No more windsurfing, no other watersports. I think I will book a single lesson for wingfoiling in the next few weeks because this will set me up for doing meaningful practice on the standup paddleboard with additional fins (discussed last week).\nSewing: All the material is washed and ready to go, but I’ve not been in the mood to sew. I’ve decided what table to buy to setup in my office as a sewing/art desk. I think having a dedicated space will make it much easier to commit time to projects (without feeling hurried by the fact that I’ve taken over the dining table). My main desk is sit-stand and very much for computers and possibly writing. I need a bigger flat space for patterns, cutting material, the sewing machine and overlocker, but also for any art projects I might ever get around too as well.\nThree ideas: Windsurfing… try again (if the wind is around on a day I can go) Book that winging lesson (so I am confident to practice on my own with the fin attachment for the standup paddleboard) Plant something (moved from last week to this week, because I need to start sometime) I am going to have to send some work-related emails next week… and I’m not looking forward to that, but it needs to be done and off my mind.\n","description":"Not a fantastic week, with the car breaking down (and me with it, to some extent)...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 10 - 16 February 2025","uri":"/post/2025/feb/weeknotes-16/"},{"content":"Hot and humid days have meant I was lacking in energy, but I did flop about in the ocean with a windsurfer two more times. I met this shield bug in the park where I recovered the second time…\n…very closely matched with the new playground’s tarmac.\nI sailed for about 20 metres, but I’m not going further until I can reliably turn the kit around, get back up and sail in the opposite direction. This is a little frustrating, but definitely a sensible call.\nReading: The re-reading of the Silo trilogy by Hugh Howey continues. I prefer the books to the television series in terms of how the story events and characters are portrayed. This isn’t surprising, since I almost always prefer what I imagine and the way that stories work in written narratives (given the option).\nI’ve also been reading New Happy having finally coughed up for a copy of the paperback. I’ve been reading their newsletters and collecting (but never remembering to listen to) the podcasts for a while. Now I’ve got more time to think about stuff it seemed worth reading the actual book and seeing if it might be helpful. The jury is still out… but I’m considering how I might use (and benefit from) modified activities based on the book and other resources. If I get anywhere I’ll write a full post about this.\nGolf: Just social golf this week. Nine on my home course and nine somewhere new. Both times I played ok, with good shots and bad. My driving is off at the moment, so I think I need to just hit some balls on the range to relax my swing and practice a reproduceable setup. That’s the plan anyway, because I’ll be back to two competition rounds middle and end of next week.\nExercise: I bailed on home weights, mostly because I was pretty tired from the beach and attempts to windsurf, but also because I still refuse to put a time aside in my calendar to help ensure that sessions actually happen. My physio session at the gym was good this week. I felt strong, balanced and in control of all the exercises.\nAlthough it is turning cooler now, continuing for the next few days, I don’t know if the humidity will ease enough for me to go running. I did go for a walk today (but I got very hot).\nFood: Doing our best with assorted meat and salad in the heat, with one quiche (from the shop). I think we end up eating a lot less fibre than when we’re cooking vegetables, given the often simple salads we like (and can be bothered to make). I don’t know if I’m motivated enough to do better though!\nGarden: Managed to half fill the bin in the heat. Trimmed the lemon tree, already stripped of fruit because of the Queensland fruit fly infiltration locally which the state is trying to eradicate. With no fruit to support the tree has been putting out new shoots (but most are vertical, which is not what you want).\nI did a bit more research into varieties of natives to plant and other things I might like to fill gaps in the garden. Spent some time looking at what was available in local garden centres this week. I found some possibles, but I’m not feeling confident enough to buy and plant at the moment. I will try to do some small things first (and see how much success I have with those) before getting into anything larger or more extensive.\nThe bird baths are visited regularly and this morning I went to buy some rocks to put in the one out the back to see if the smaller birds prefer having a shallower section and somewhere to perch. If that works out then I’ll do the same for the front.\nCactus repotting requirements continue to be the job I am putting off. They are dangerous beasts and I fear I will be stabbed!\nAdventure: I went (almost) windsurfing two more times! The second time I actually did sail a bit (but as I noted above, I need to build my skills before heading off further from shore).\nLast year I researched a fin kit that can be used to allow you to use a wing on a standup paddleboard and sail properly (ie allow you to go up and down wind, rather than just sliding off the wind, which is what happens without a centreboard). I couldn’t find anyone with stock in my state at that time, but I found it this week. Looking foward to trying this (although I don’t really have much of a clue what I’m doing with the wing having just stood on the beach getting the feel of it thus far). Maybe one lesson might help and then I can take my time practicing with my own equipment before attempting more lessons with the foil?\nSewing: The skirt I made last week has been worn almost every day, so I’m clearly pretty happy with the pattern. My last post gave a lot more information about the small alterations I’ll make before sewing another. This week I bought more material (and also realised just how much of a stash I have from over a year ago when I was about to make lots of things and then stopped because work took over and I got overwhelmed and demoralised). Not all of my material pile is for skirts, but quite a bit is… maybe for this pattern and another I used a while back (that also needs alteration for fit).\nThree ideas: Windsurfing… keep trying (maybe at the river, or maybe the ocean, we’ll see) Try out the fin attachment for the standup paddleboard with my wing (?? depends on many things, not all of which are in my control) Plant something (?!) This week I handwrote a set of notes/mindmap for potential research paper ideas, but did not return to them (which I felt I would if I was inspired, so likely was not). There might be something else I could write about that popped up recently in the news, but it might just turn into a blog post rather than a journal article. More on that another time (whatever I do).\n","description":"Hot and humid days have meant I was lacking in energy, but I did flop about in the ocean with a windsurfer two more times.

I like the way the semi-patched pockets break up the plain skirt. The patterned skirts will have pockets set into the side seams and waistband (the latter to improve weight distribution, see below) instead.\nThe pattern I drafted myself was based on the skirts I’ve owned for ages (and worn to death). There are just four pieces to the pattern: front (cut on fold), back (cut on fold), waistband (cut on fold) and pocket (x2 for semi-patched and x4 of a different shape for the inset version).\nThe result was too big at first (because I always add too much ease up front and then realise that things can be more fitted with a better line, yet still comfortable to wear). I tacked the pieces together with my sewing machine, noted the sizing issue, and then… with much trepidation… got out my overlocker (serger) for the first time and used that to both re-stich and cut down the side seams (and the pockets in fact, because these were also too large so could take the same reduction). Most things I read about overlockers imply you should practice with them, take your time to learn, etc, but I just jumped straight in… and it was fine on the cheap, linen/cotton fabric I was using!\nThe overlocker is a revelation. The seams and finish are just great. I guess I might have issues in the future if I don’t take a bit more care to practice with stretch materials, for example. Then there’s the whole question of re-threading… although if you pay attention then you can cheat by pulling the new threads through the machine after knotting them to the existing ones.\nI ended up using this simple method to attach the waistband, rather than the more complex one I learnt ages ago. With the overlocker to finish the edge the simple method works well and allows for adjustment.\nThe inset pocket alteration I’ll be using for the patterned skirts took some time to research. I found I’d saved a reel that described what I wanted. As the video explains, the advantage of this design is that it distributes the weight of the contents into the waistband, thus allowing you to put your heavy phone (or whatever) into the pocket without destroying the line of the skirt. The drafting information took a while to find, and then an example where it is used for a skirt took even longer to locate, but it all makes sense now.\nSo… once I have resized the pattern itself (because I’ve been too busy wearing my skirt and doing other things to get around to that yet) and made a few other alterations (mainly a wider waistband to accommodate wider elastic for a flatter finish and the alternate inset pocket piece) I’ll be making more. I’ve got material for at least two more plain in other colours and two patterned. Finally I will have all the skirts I have ever wanted.\n","description":"Since I can't find skirts I like, and my wear-all-the-time skirts are wearing out too much to fix easily, I have finally drafted a pattern and made my own...","tags":["Sewing"],"title":"Drafting patterns and sewing skirts","uri":"/post/2025/feb/drafting-and-sewing-skirts/"},{"content":"Back down to the windsurfing beach this week and I had a go this time…\n…but it didn’t go great!\nOn a positive note, all my new kit fitted well, I was very comfortable and my leg brace felt fine (so fine that really I didn’t notice it at all unless I was kneeling on the board trying to uphaul). Negatives? I was too scared to put up a large enough sail for the conditions (in case more wind came in while I was out), so I struggled to beach and water start. This was the reason for attempting to uphaul, but in spite of my balance being way better than it has ever been, I couldn’t handle the chop.\nThe beach was nice though, as you can see from the header image for this post.\nMaybe next time will go better (and I might try the river with a larger board).\nReading: I’ve been trying, and failing, to read some books recently. We’ve had a few false starts trying new (to us) science fiction authors. D gave up and returned to an old set of fantasy books, but I’d forgotten how disturbing I find torture (a feature mainly of the first of the novels in the trilogy). I’ve read this set of books before, and was ok, but it doesn’t make me comfortable now. I stopped.\nI’ve decided instead to re-read the Silo trilogy by Hugh Howey. We’re on to the second season of the television adaptation and I’ve been wondering how similar the storylines are (given the need often to make things quite different to work for the audiovisual watcher-listener rather than the reader). So far I’m finding that the stories match in terms of events, but that some characters are more dominant in the television adaptation. Explanations for why things happen are also a little different. I’m not sure if I’ll need to halt my reading to avoid overtaking the viewing experience.\nGolf: I’m playing more consistently again. It’s remarkable how much easier it is to play well when practicing as opposed to taking part in competition though. There’s less pressure and often more time to get into a rhythym. It’s the rhythym of the walking and the shots that really makes a difference for me. As soon as I need to speed up (because I, or someone I’m playing with, has hit issues and we’re holding up the field) my play often goes off the rails!\nI’ve continued to think about a practice schedule. I’ve got some ideas for what to do at the driving range now (and I’ve been saving short simple tips as I see them on social media, this being one of the reasons that I don’t want to leave social media behind completely atm).\nExercise: I managed 25 minutes of home weights on top of my physio session this week, which was better than I’ve ever done before (or maybe since the first few months when I was in recovery from my injury so was a bit more motivated to do all the at home exercises regularly). This is good. I’m feeling strong and its paying off in terms of how well I’m going with golf, gardening and (almost) windsurfing.\nStill contemplating the idea of a run. Maybe the week after next when it really might be cooler.\nFood: We’re continuing to eat pretty well. It turns out that steak, red wine and cheese can be a bit much these days! (I slept so badly that the next day I had to take it easy.) No hangover, just soooo tired.\nGarden: Filled the bin again, although I thought it’d be a struggle. I took out an aloe that was trying to make it into the pool (before it got so big as to be a two person job). I also trimmed back some other succulent ground cover.\nI did a bunch of research into varieties of natives that are good for insects and birds. I’m thinking of planting some large natives where our front lawn is struggling, turning that square into bush (with the larger plants meaning we can just cut the grass back underneath rather than attempting to take what remains out completely).\nThe bird baths are still filled on the reg, but I haven’t seen much action. The pigeons seem to like the front garden now though.\nOMG. The large cactus… and Milligan (a succulent with the vicious spikes out front) both need repotting.\nAdventure: I almost went windsurfing! Not sure about wingfoiling now. Confused. Here’s a seagull I saw fly over when I was sitting on the beach recovering:\nSewing: I made a skirt. It’s effectively a wearable toile of the pattern I made for myself. I had to alter it a bit as I made it, with that job made a lot easier by initial tacking with the sewing machine before using my new overlocker to cut it down to size!\nThe overlocker is magic. The finish is great. I’m looking forward to making my next tee-shirt now, because it’ll make stretch fabric so much easier to work and the final product much more professional.\nThree ideas: Windsurfing… try again (maybe hire a big board and go to the river, or just go to the river for a less choppy experience) Buy really nice fabric for skirt no. 2 See if I can locate plants The Work section has not made a reappearance, in spite of the fact that it should have… read into that what you will.\n","description":"Back down to the windsurfing beach this week and I had a go this time...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 27 January - 2 February 2025","uri":"/post/2025/feb/weeknotes-02/"},{"content":"Don’t get too excited. I don’t kitesurf (since a scary experience just after I finished lessons) and I haven’t yet managed to get back on the windsurfer. I did make it to the beach…\n…but it was way too windy and choppy for me to want to go out!\nThis week’s image shows just a few of the kites that were up. There was a competition in the bay, but it’s often this busy anyway. D had a good sail, but even he said it was challenging. Glad I stayed on dry land!\nMaybe tomorrow?\nReading: I finished the last of the Detective Kindaichi Mysteries by Seishi Yokomizo earlier this week. It followed the same pattern, with quite a few deaths and a convoluted story of interpersonal relationships. This series brought back memories of reading detective novels as a teenager. Although I read a lot of contemporary fiction at that time, I also went through my parents collection of Penguin paperbacks. Dorothy L. Sayers and Ngaio Marsh were two of my favourite authors. Now I feel like going back to revisit those novels, although I wonder if I’d enjoy them as much now.\nI’ve moved on to other novels (not thrillers). In terms of nonfiction… well, I’d like to get hold of a book I’ve seen on supporting black cockatoos in gardens (although I’m interested in supporting birdlife more broadly too), and I might even be interested in a research-related book!?\nGolf: I’m playing ok at the moment, but very up and down. It has been hot, so I’ve not been practising. I’d really like to spend time on some basic drills and maybe get some coaching again. It’s pretty much impossible to be completely consistent, but with some practice I really should be able to make my rounds less of a rollercoaster. I know I should spend at least some of that time on putting, but it’s my least favourite thing to work on!\nAs it gets a bit cooler I’m going to work out a practice schedule for myself. Setup and pre-shot routine will be the first things to get more comfortable with (across everything, from driving to putting). I could try changing my grip again (but that’d really stuff everything up and I might just end up with sore fingers again, so maybe not a good idea).\nExercise: I managed 20 minutes of home weights on top of my physio session and it was enough to make me sore the next day, so I did well this week. I’d like to get to either one additional 30 minute session, or a couple of shorter ones each week ideally. I did some research (ie I used my academic library access) on osteoporosis and exercise, which reinforced the idea that weights at least a couple of times a week would be good for me. It’s not enough to jump around (contra what you might see on social media). I’d provide the research paper links here, but unfortunately they were all paywalled, so there’s not much point sharing. Just ask if you’re interested in knowing more.\nI contemplated going for a run this week, but it was hot and humid. I think I made the right call not going. I do feel as if I’ll get back into it when it’s cooler now.\nFood: We’re continuing to do ok in terms of eating. Had one takeaway this week, which helped because I’ve been struggling to feel enthused about cooking, in particular when it’s been hot.\nGarden: This week I filled the bin with couch grass from the front garden. It had got out of hand and, even though it is almost impossible to remove compeltely, the bed looks a lot better now. I’ll just need to keep removing it when it sprouts (trying to dig out as many of the runners as I can). Once I’ve done that for a few weeks I might consider planting some more succulents or maybe natives (for birds etc). Whatever I plant needs to be drought tolerant (given no reticulation in that bed and my irregular hand waterering schedule to contend with)!\nI bought two simple terracotta birdbath bowls, one for the front and one for the back. It was forecast to be hot and I wanted to give the birds somewhere to cool down and take a drink (also lizards, but I don’t think we have that many at the moment). Both have definitely seen some action. I saw a raven drinking and cooling its feet out the front and a wagtail having a bath out the back.\nI did buy a pot for the large cactus, but have not attempted to move it yet!\nAdventure: I got no further on organising wingfoiling lessons. Maybe that’ll be easier if I have a try at windsurfing again when its a bit less ballistic?\nSewing: The skirt-making project I’ve been planning for weeks is in progress! It’s imperative that I get this pattern to work - although I’m very aware the first attempt might not be successful. More on this next week (I hope).\nThree ideas: Windsurfing… and/or get onto someone about wingfoiling lessons Finish (?) the skirt, or at least get somewhere Set aside 15 minutes to outline a potential journal article argument (or pull the pin officially) The Work section was replaced with Sewing this week, hence the article argument appearing again in the three ideas list. I seem to have no desire to do research writing work at all. Suddenly all I wanted to do was to cut material and sew. Weird.\n","description":"Don't get too excited.

It might have something to do with wanting to feel I’m improving my golf game (but still only managing to play well for half any given round). It might be because, while I do want to fulfil my writing commitments this month and next, I don’t actually want to do the writing. Then again, it could be my indecision around organising wing foiling lessons and the fact that I’ve not decided to go windsurfing yet this year. I’m scared - I know that, know why and respect that feeling - but I would still like to give these things a go (again).\nThis week’s image is related to preparing for the heat now and all through next week: reflections in the pool whose cooling embrace will be needed in just a few moments.\nReading: Nearing the end of the Detective Kindaichi Mysteries by Seishi Yokomizo series now, I’m still enjoying the gentle narratives, well drawn characters and many dead bodies often artfully presented. The stories always feature a number of missed opportunities to find out key pieces of information that would prevent more death.\nI’m still not reading anything else, but I’m happy to be finding more and more interesting personal blogs and people to follow on Mastodon.\nGolf: My golf was ok on Wednesday and poor on Friday (after a great start). My mood on Wednesday was upbeat. I did a bit of practice before I left after lunch. Friday though… Well, I got quite (read: incandescently) angry with myself (although I don’t think my playing partners noticed the level of rage). I was still hitting some good shots, but there were a few things I did wrong repeatedly, in spite of making adjustments that should have helped. I could not putt (with an issue that plagued me the whole round, but that I failed to correct effectively at all). Again, I did more practice before leaving for home, and that did make me feel a bit better (but not much).\nExercise: I managed 5 minutes of additional weights on top of my physio session. Hmm… must do better (yet another irritation).\nRunning? Not in the wind (and now, not in the heat).\nFood: We’re doing pretty well in terms of eating atm. I’m quite enjoying it most of the time, with the occasional issue (when I’ve already been feeling peeved).\nGarden: My dedication to getting stuff done in the garden - watering things and sorting out pots, cuttings and planning future changes - is going well. I’m actually enjoying this a lot!\nI continued to put off sorting out the huge cactus with a new pot and it took matters into its own… spines. Part of it fell off, so I potted up the pups and cut the large section off clean (above any rot/dry die back) to see if I can pot that up when it develops a callus.\nAdventure: I had already located three potential places for wingfoiling lessons by the end of last week. I think I’ll go with one of the two offering individual lessons (more expensive, but probably worth it). Now I’m having issues getting down to making a booking. I’m thinking of emailing them to see how responsive they are and what they think about teaching someone who is using a hinged knee brace to protect a permanently injured knee (no ACL on that side, no pain but potentially unstable if twisted).\nThe thought of skiing (or maybe snowboarding) at some point this year continues to be in my head (and not always in a positive way, but I don’t want to just give up).\nWork (a new section): I did manage to set the timer for 15 minutes twice this week and actually considered the most urgent writing project on the books for about two hours in the end. I can write this, but only if I work out what I want to argue in the next few days (making the article different from everything I’ve already said, but also fun to write, with the latter being key to me now). The deadline is looming dangerously close.\nThree ideas: Email two of the possible wingfoiling teachers about lessons for someone with a knee brace Find and buy a cactus pot Set aside 15 minutes to outline a potential journal article argument I don’t think anyone reads these weeknotes, but if they do then they might notice that they’re always posted a day (or even two days) late. This is in part because I’m struggling to feel I’m moving forward, in particular with the adventure/ideas aspects of my life, so I don’t want to write up what feels like a failure (until I’ve had a chance to move at least one of the things along ready to report on in the next week). I guess that means the accountability aspect of writing these is almost working!?!?\n","description":"For some reason this was a week dominated by irritability...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 13 - 19 January 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jan/weeknotes-19/"},{"content":"A week in which it turned out that watching golf (ie walking the course with the players) is just as tiring physically as playing golf…\nThis week there was a professional competition at my club, so I got the chance to play another great local course for free (because we get offered alternative tee times elsewhere when we can’t access our own course). However, this didn’t mean I wasn’t walking my own course, because I followed the golf competition for three days (well the pro am for one, then Friday and Sunday of the actual comp)! The cover image shows a view across the 18th hole.\nOther than that, this week was much like last week: gardening, cooking and reading.\nReading: Still working through the Detective Kindaichi Mysteries by Seishi Yokomizo series and not feeling the urge to read anything else other than blogs and a bit of news (but mostly skimming the latter). I’m certainly not setting aside time for research-related reading right now (and this is giving me some anxiety, because I do have outstanding research writing on my list)!\nThe body count in each of the Kindaichi novels continues to be high!\nGolf: Last week I noted that my golf had slumped, so it was great to play somewhere new this week. Being somewhere different alters your thinking about your game, because suddenly you’re concentrating on working out what to do even more than usual, rather than the shot itself as one you’ve played many times before. My playing partner had visited the course before so offered advice on some holes (ie “avoid the left hand side” or “there’s a sharp dog leg right here”, etc). It was hot, so we were driving the round together sharing a cart, which meant I didn’t get overtired (a feature of last week’s experience).\nExercise: As I mentioned, following the golf (not playing) has still meant I’ve covered a lot of kms this week. Alongside working in the garden, this meant I skimped on home weights and only managed a quick body weight set of single leg exercises this week. I did have a proper physio weights session, which was focused on high repetitions of low-ish weight to fatigue (and in the heat that made me pretty nauseous). I clearly got to the stage when my red face suddenly turned white, because my physio made the choice to bail on the last set!\nI would still like to get back to running, in part because I’m watching my friends run via Strava and feeling guilty for not getting out myself. Still not sure whether that’s enough to get me motivated though!\nFood: I’ve continued to cook a fair bit, in between being tired from walking and getting easy food options from the store. I took advantage of the cooler weather later in the week to cook chicken pasta and pork thai curry. It was good to leave the barbecue and salad behind for a couple of days.\nGarden: I continued to prune and tidy the garden. I did some work in the front and back gardens this time. Pruning in the back I found the cactus (? could be a large succulent) that D says is a regular interloper from next door. When I cut that back I kept a few cuttings which I’ve potted up. I must remember to water them! The green bin still has some space, so maybe I’ll get back out there.\nI am still putting off repotting the huge cactus… and that’s because I’d like to find a nice pot (because I’m not planning on moving it again any time soon). Finding something that I like (just something plain and simple) of the appopriate size has proved more difficult than I expected.\nWith no pot, I’ve not yet organised help for the repotting task (see last week’s three ideas for this and in relation to Adventure and Work below).\nAdventure: We continue to discuss how to test my ability on the snow. Having snapped my ACL last time out, we know that I’ll be petrified, but I’m much stronger now too, so might get on ok. Planning a break where a couple of days skiing is an option seems like the best idea. Maybe Melbourne, Canberra or New Zealand (and I’m pretty keen on the last of those).\nI located three potential places for wingfoiling lessons, but haven’t managed to decide on whether group lessons or individual are best for me. I can see pros and cons both ways. I think I might email each place to find out their reaction to teaching someone with a knee brace (because I’m not trying anything new without using my brace). I guess I should write a post about the whole ACL/knee thing at some point.\nWork (a new section): I did not set aside a couple of hours to assess the feasability of the journal article I committed to write. I think I may need to approach this in 15 minute chunks (advice I happily give other people, but often do not take myself).\nThree ideas: Book some wingfoiling lessons (on the basis of email responses about knees, maybe?!) Organise cactus repotting (so, find and buy the damn pot!) Set aside 15 minutes to assess the journal article writing (and hope this, or a few of these, will break the anxiety spiral) Writing this weeknote I felt a bit flat. I enjoyed watching the golf, but it took up a lot of time. The gardening was definitely worthwhile and the food I cooked was good, but I have a lot of anxiety about research writing (aka my sword of Damocles) that has meant a lot of time spend avoiding the task (by doomscrolling mostly).\n","description":"A week in which it turned out that watching golf (ie walking the course with the players) is just as tiring physically as playing golf...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 6 - 12 January 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jan/weeknotes-12/"},{"content":"The first of the new look weeknotes as we move into the new year…\nThree walks this week, plus “a good walk spoiled” (ie a game of golf, as in the quotation commonly misattributed to Mark Twain). The cover image for this weeknote is my favourite Banksia on the way back from our regular river walk, because I love the orange colour.\nReading: Most of my reading for pleasure is science fiction and fantasy, although I also enjoy crime fiction (not true crime). As a holiday reading treat, I bought the whole series of Detective Kindaichi Mysteries by Seishi Yokomizo (in English translated from Japanese, since my ability with Japanese is very limited in spite of some effort to learn). I found out about these novels from a personal website I read as part of my research for how to organise my own weeknotes (but I’m not sure which one, sorry)!\nYokomizo’s novels follow formats for detective novels that are familiar to me from reading Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, etc (mostly years ago), but the Japanese setting, both physical and cultural, makes them an interesting read aside from the crime and crime solving narratives themselves. I’ve not read all the books yet, so I’m still thinking through my reaction to each of them and the set. One had a very high body count, getting to the point where I’d laugh and comment “another one down” in explanation for D.\nGolf: My golf had been going pretty well, but it seems to have slumped for the last two games. This may be because it’s been a bit too hot for me, or due to difficulties getting to practice (too hot and/or the course has been closed for maintenance in the run up to a big professional competition next week). The main issue has been lack of stamina over 18 holes. Once your body and/or mind is tired, it is very difficult to play well. I do tire easily in the heat. I’ve not been sleeping that well every night (because I’ve been overeating and drinking a bit too much sometimes). Maybe I’m also just worn out from a delayed release of work tension now I’m hitting the new year and realising that work isn’t just going to start up again like normal?!\nWhatever the cause, the key thing is just to relax and enjoy each game as much as possible. I’m not a pro!! I’m just out there to have a good time. It is frustrating not to play as well as you know you can, but it’s not the end of the world either.\nExercise: As I mentioned, I’ve walked quite a bit (three times). I also did a proper weights session at home (on New Year’s day, when I’d bailed from golf due to the heat). I’m concentrating on single leg exercises and other exercises that complement my physiotherapy sessions (on hold for two weeks over the holidays).\nI would like to get back to running, but that is a challenge when it’s hot. I’ll have to get better at getting up early if I’m going to run (which is difficult because two days a week I already get up early for golf, and I love a lie in)!\nFood: I’ve been cooking a lot, or sometimes preparing a lot in support of D’s barbecue expertise. We’ve had couscous salad twice (once when we had guests, but that reminded me how easy it is to make). I’ve perfected a new potato salad “recipe” (although it’s not a recipe really, I just actually bothered to look up some inspiration for how to dress the potatoes better)! I’d never realised that 2 sour cream: 1 mayonnaise was the way to go, with the addition of some dijon (often something I added before), a dash of vinegar (my preference being sherry vinegar not those suggested in recipes I read), finely chopped spring onion and a dash of olive oil (vital, but maybe that’s just me?) plus the usual salt and pepper to taste. This is much better than the mayonnaise-heavy version I had been making. (Note: I cheat using bought mayonnaise, but it has to be good, and the dash of olive oil is probably something I need because of this decision.)\nGarden: Now I’ve stopped working I finally like gardening (a bit/in short bursts)! I’ve been pruning, slowly and carefully shaping some bushes that have been choking one of the small trees at the end of the garden. I’ve got lots more to do, but the green bin is full now so I can rest.\nThe job I’m putting off, but need to do, is repotting the huge cactus first mentioned here.\nAdventure: This section should be about fun and exciting things like stand up paddleboarding adventures, windsurfing, wingfoiling and, eventually, travel for skiing and/or snow boarding. None of these things have happened… yet. My excuse? It’s been the holidays, so all the places to go/learn have been busy. I won’t have that excuse soon!\nThree ideas: Make an attempt to book some wingfoiling lessons Organise when to do the cactus (because I need G to help with this task) Set aside a couple of hours to assess the journal article I have committed to write Writing this weeknote felt pretty good! I was more reflective and thoughtful, so got more out of the process. Those final three ideas may not work out well, but it’s worth a shot. Maybe they’ll motivate me, because I do actually want to do all those things (but I have been putting them off for various reasons).\n","description":"The first of the new look weeknotes as we move into the new year...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 30 December 2024 - 5 January 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jan/weeknotes-05/"},{"content":"Entering the new year with a new plan for weeknotes…\nAlthough I enjoyed writing my first few weeknote instalments last year, they got harder (or less pleasurable?) to write each week. This was, in part, because they began to feel repetitive, boring and forced. I was using the previous note as a template for the new note and this seemed to make it easier to repeat myself without moving things forward (although I had hoped that strategy would result in precisely the opposite effect, ie making building on the old post easy!?). Of course, the repetition/boredom was likely also a symptom of my usual holiday slump (because I am far less likely to go out to do things when everyone else is also out doing things). Can’t wait for everyone else to go back to work (sorry, not sorry)!\nMy recent post “What’s with the weeknotes” cemented the ethos of this space as personal rather than professional, with weeknotes being a part of that decision. In light of Tracy Durnell’s idea of weeknotes as a tool for attention, I’ve identified a few goals for my weeknotes:\nThis mindmap amounts to the following goals (and the headings identified further down):\nmotivation via accountability (a gentle push to help me do the things I want to do) tracking to enhance memory (because my mind tends to focus on failure rather than achievement, and I’m dreadful at remembering when things happened) sharing (no pressure to gain an audience, but if my writing turns out to be helpful to others then great) planning (reasonable expectations) What I’m doing on this website relates to my move from employed to unemployed (as D consistently points out, I’m not retired, I’m too young to draw my pension). No longer on an externally defined work schedule, I think I need to create some structure for myself (but structure that encourages trying new things, some of which might spark joy, as well as sticking to things that are good to do regularly).\nI took a look at some other people’s weeknotes to see what they wrote. Some make a list (similar to the way I’ve been including a list of “Stuff I did”). Most people have headings (not all of which appear every week). These headings might be for lists or paragraph of text.\nSince I don’t want to shut down my free-writing rambles completely, I’m going to use headings and paragraphs. I’m cutting down the final list of plans to record “Three ideas”, for fun/new things I’d like to do/try in the next week (or so). The “Plans” section I had last year was too long, repetitive and did not motivate me to action regularly enough!\nHeadings:\nReading Golf Exercise Food Garden Adventure Three ideas I’m going to see how this goes for January. It’s my website, so I can change things whenever I want, but I’ll give it about a month to test the new, more structured, approach properly. My hope is that as well as helping make my weeknotes more helpful to me (and maybe interesting for other people), I’ll also identify topics and ideas to expand on in other more informative/analytical/thoughtful posts.\n","description":"Entering the new year with a new plan for weeknotes...","tags":["Weeknotes","Writing"],"title":"Re-visioning weeknotes","uri":"/post/2025/jan/re-visioning-weeknotes/"},{"content":"It’s been just over a month since I left my permanent job, so it’s early days in the rest of my life…\nI’ve been writing weeknotes since my last week at work, which is something unexpected (for me, as someone who doesn’t write easily and has never managed to keep a diary for more than a few days) maybe that deserves some explanation, as I put a bit more thought into this website, why I decided to post weeknotes at all and how to keep going with this (and other writing).\nAlthough I am always careful with formal research notes, tracking where my ideas come from (or how new ideas developed) with citations and references, in the everyday my memory for sources and the history of my thinking is far less organised. That’s probably quite a good thing, most of the time, but it is one of the reasons I find it difficult to write here. I’m not a natural writer. I struggle with words and my inner critic makes it difficult to just write without continual deletions and corrections made possible by electronic interfaces.\nThe idea for a new, post-work, website came about gradually. My teaching over the last two years made me increasingly aware how using the internet and the web, once so remarkable and pleasurable, was becoming frustrating and anger-inducing. In 2024, I began to spend more time looking for personal websites and blogs to follow and read regularly. Sometimes this was driven by, and sometimes it drove, the discovery of podcasts too.\nI’m pretty sure (ie I’m hoping this is not a complete fiction, see above on my difficulties tracking everyday reading and thinking) planning a new online space all started with listening to Jay Springett’s podcast Permanently Moved, although now I say that I’m wondering how I found that podcast in the first place! I thought about making my own podcast. Actually, it went a bit further than just thinking, but the recordings didn’t end up being released for public consumption. I’m not completely sure, but it seems likely that Springett’s podcast, website and blog posts were what put me onto Tracy Durnell’s Mind Garden, which helped me work out what I wanted to do (and also linked various other sites to read).\nThis reading of, and thinking about, personal web spaces rolled into some of my teaching in 2024, mostly for the Writing on the Web unit. I shared my enthusiasm for decentralisation and open independent websites written by people without (often) the primary goal of commercial gain, tempered by awareness that commercial viability, whether as an individual or a small business, was going to be important to many of my students. Personally though, I just wanted to leave largescale commercial platforms behind, or at least be less reliant on them as drivers for my online experience. I think this is one reason why I left my job, which I felt required me to engage with as many different social media platforms and social network sites as possible all the time. This situation often made me anxious and sometimes also sad.\nI spent weeks trying to work out where I wanted to set up my new site. I dabbled with Hugo and then Jeckyll, before returning to setup a site using a Hugo template that was very different from my old website. There’s more on this process here (in relation to the early build) and here (in relation to template choice). You can see that I stuck with the card style template. After I finished work I sorted out a URL to get things to where they are now.\nEventually I’m hoping that this place will allow me to realise the secret power of a blog, but for now it’s popoulated mainly with short weeknotes. I’m still finding myself shut down by perfectionism when I try to write more involved or thoughtful posts - with this piece being maybe a little more substantial. (Yay for small gains!) I find the weeknotes easier (not easy), in part because there’s little need to track and link to multiple sources to justify what I’m saying. There are some informative links in my weeknotes, but these integrate seamlessly as I document my week.\nMy weeknotes so far have had a simple structure I’d describe as:\nHeader image A rambling summary with other images and links where appropriate Stuff I did Plans Postscript In keeping with at least part of the ethos of another person maintaining their own digital space, Anh, my website is personal over professional (in spite of the research writing information it contains). It isn’t primarily designed to find work. This also means that I’m focused on writing things meaningful to me and maybe a (very) small number of people who are interested. My site is not directed towards building a large audience.\nMy weeknotes fulfil this ethos. They are personal (but I am being careful with self-disclosure) and most people would not be interested in the content. However, I have already found them useful when I can’t remember the details of something I’m trying to talk to someone about! More generally, as Tracy Durnell explains, weeknotes can be a tool for attention. This is an aspect I’d like to develop further. I suspect the starting point will be to decide on a more structured format for my weeknotes. I don’t want to shut down the free-writing ramble (because I think that’s good for me), but maybe some narrower sections to follow that would be helpful? These could be designed to encourage me to get around to doing things I want to do (but sometimes forget about as the days go by).\nHey! New Year is a good time to be thinking about this, so I’m going to leave it here for now. Let’s see what plan I come up with in the next few days. If I can I’ll consider how weeknotes could be used to foster other types of post too.\n","description":"It's been just over a month since I left my permanent job, so it's early days in *the rest of my life*...","tags":["Writing","Web","Identity","Life"],"title":"What's with the weeknotes?","uri":"/post/2024/dec/whats-with-the-weeknotes/"},{"content":"Christmas is normally only celebrated in our house with food and drink, but this year we got the new lights out and decorated the owl with my Christmas golf outfit hat…\nStill only managing the basic weeknote writing and almost not getting that done this week!\nIt was hot, hot, hot, and then unseasonably cold for Christmas. The seabreeze came in strong, which was not a cause for celebration in a household containing an injured windsurfer. We went for a few walks instead and saw some amazing trees on one of them.\nI had to look them up (and they weren’t at all what I thought they were). These Delonix regia, also known as royal ponciana or peacock flower, were really quite amazing as a group in one of the more wind protected areas on our walk. The rest of the walk was pretty blowy (and that was inland around the river). It was cold enough that following the eve tradition of prawns we could have roast duck breast on the day itself, accompanied by roast potatoes and a new dish of roasted brussel sprouts and butternut squash (which I, um, over-caramalised a little) with walnuts and feta. Most unusual on a day often so hot that a barbecue and cold salads are the only options.\nHaving managed not to over eat or drink, I embarked on back to back golf games over two days. This was unwise, as it turned out. I didn’t manage to protect my eyes properly on the first, slept poorly, and by the end of the second day’s play I was red-eyed, very tired and more than a little grumpy! At least I slept well after all that exercise, so my eyes recovered pretty quickly this time.\nStuff I did: Golf x2 Home strength/weights x1 (super short, so I need to get back into this asap) Lots of other walks (together) A lot of cooking (just for the two of us though, so not difficult) Plans: Get back into home strength/weights (x2 or x3) Golf x2 Beach walk and/or swim Make a skirt (because I did not do this last week or the week before) Get on the water? (will I do this, given D’s injured shoulder?) More garden pruning I may well focus on doing things other than writing. It just feels better for now.

The Vector robot is still operational, so that planned post will also get written eventually (and I have some video to share too).\nWith very little writing happening, this week was dominated by golf, with a practice 9-hole round of social golf on Monday and two competition rounds later in the week. Practice was great. It’s good to spend time with different people, and I got to catch up with a friend I’ve not played with in ages. Being more relaxed also means I get to find out how well I can hit the ball, which is pretty well at the moment! A better understanding of what you can do really helps your confidence when you’re struggling a bit in a competition. In spite of the increasingly hot and dry conditions (or maybe because, I’m not sure actually), there were toadstools on course this week.\nI was glad to get out on course when it wasn’t too hot (still up to 34/35 degrees on Wednesday though). I need to get my water intake right, because when I don’t a sudden slump (both mental and physical) can spoil a nice score. When not playing golf I made a trip to the beach, not for a walk, but to get in the ocean. Getting more at home swimming at the beach (something I really don’t do anymore and that makes me nervous now) is one of my goals, so it was great to go and a good way to test out the car key safe I mentioned last time.\nI can feel myself struggling with self-disclosure in this writing. That may be because I’m writing for myself with little sense that anyone else would be at all interested, but also very concious of writing into a public space for accountability. The balance felt easy early on… but less so now. I’m not sure where this is going, or whether I’ll manage to continue!\nStuff I did: Physio (last one for a couple of weeks) Short ocean swim Golf x2.5 Home strength/weights x2 (one very short, one a bit longer and with more weight, with a much better recovery than last week!) Tidying up some of the spikey plants and dead bits in the garden bed I can see from our seating area Plans: Continue with home strength/weights (x2 or x3) Christmas cheer (mostly food and some drink, but no presents) Golf x2 Beach walk and/or swim (but it’s busy at the beach now its the holidays, so maybe not?) Make a skirt (because I did not do this last week) Get on the water? (will I do this, given D’s injured shoulder?) More garden pruning Writing (I will try to get a blogpost/research writing summary out in addition to my weeknote) Writing, other than these rambles, is the thing that gets forgotten first. It’s too hot to want to run while managing dry eyes. Golf is good, but I’m very pleased that I’m getting into the garden a bit more and have a sewing project on the go.\n","description":"The frangipanis are flowering and it's getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 16 - 22 December 2024","uri":"/post/2024/dec/weeknotes-22/"},{"content":"A week where I got some worthwhile things done, but also went onto campus and back to (unpaid) thinking and writing work too soon…\nAlthough I’m planning a post (or series of posts) about plants and the garden, I did promise pictures of the Echinopsis oxygona cactus flowers. One of the blooms fell off as it opened, but then managed pretty well inside, while the remaining one outside made it through its single spectacular day safely. A friend’s cactus flowered on the same day, so it may have been the heat that encouraged the buds to double in size and then open over the course of a day, remaining open the next day before wilting.\nThese weren’t the only large white flowers gracing the front garden this week, with the Magolia grandiflora “Teddy Bear” also blooming this week.\nThe cactus may have enjoyed the heat on Wednesday, but it was too hot for me so I pulled out of the golf competition. I had already played nine holes on Monday (social/practice). It was good to play with no competition pressure and I took the chance to try a few things that I might not when keeping a score.\nI didn’t make the most of the heat to visit a beach for a walk/swim, but I did take time to prepare the way by sorting out a signal blocking key pouch for my car key safe. Yes, a thick piece of aluminium foil was working most of the time, but it made the lock really difficult to close and open again (which meant I wasn’t happy to use it)! Being able to leave your car safely locked with the key also locked away is essential when swimming, paddle-boarding, windsurfing or anything else. I love keyless unlocking when my hands are full, but not when I’m trying to work out how to get in the ocean while keeping electronic keys secure (and keeping valuables in the locked car).\nA plan to visit Curtin campus on Thursday for an event meant that I could also catch up with a colleague for lunch. I took in some sushi from my local Japanese restaurant for us both (because it was too hot to walk across campus comfortably). The debate event I attended was pretty good fun, but it felt like I’d gone back too soon… the rumination it sparked has proved to be unsettling rather than enjoyable.\nWhile I was on campus I took time to visit the John Curtin gallery. The picks of the visit for me were in the John Stringer Prize Retrospective. Alistair Rowe’s “Angles of incidence” made from wood, glass and ерохy cast beautiful patterns with its lighting.\nMy favourite was Susan Roux’s “Ground(lace)ness/Traliegrond” (Canson photographic paper, Hahnemuhle paper, oil pigment, thread and ink). The photo below is just a detail from the whole piece, but I was trying to record the way the materials worked together. I’m fascinated by the use of thread in this type of artwork. Roux has a website, but I couldn’t find one for Rowe.\nIt was cool enough for golf on Friday and, given that I managed to do some weights/strength exercises at home on Thursday before heading to campus, I’m allowing myself the beach walk and running fail this week. I’ve got my daily handicap back down to 27, which was my goal for the second half of the year.\nI’ve got plans for more blogposts - maybe the first will be about writing on the web itself, since I find writing topic posts more difficult than these, rather rambling, weeknotes. I did do some reading and have some ideas for the abstract writing I meant to do… but it’s not proving easy to get down to the job. There are a few reasons for that, I think, but I don’t want to discuss them at the moment!\nI bought some cheap material to trial making a skirt (with my own pattern based on a couple of simple boxy skirts I have worn almost to death over the last few years). If I can get this right over a few tries future me will be very happy.\nStuff I did: Physio Golf x1.5 Home strength/weights (just a very short session, but the aftermath showed they were worth it) More preparation for time in/on the water… Clearing fruit from the garden - because we are in the midst of a “Qfly” (Queensland Fruit Fly) outbreak in Perth (and are trying to eradicate them) Plans: Physio Home strength/weights Golf x2 Beach walk and swim Finish office tidy up Make a skirt Get on the water? (wind, weather and energy allowing) Writing (probably a blogpost in addition to my weeknote) Running has fallen off the list. The abstract has also gone. I will see how I go with both these things, but they’re just not happening at the moment. It’ll be weather and mental health dependent respectively, I think.\n","description":"A week where I got some worthwhile things done, but also went onto campus and back to (unpaid) thinking and writing work too soon...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 9 - 15 December 2024","uri":"/post/2024/dec/weeknotes-15/"},{"content":"Still trying to settle into my new life. I did manage to get a few things done while also trying to chill out (and avoid feeling like I have to do all the things all at once)…\nThe Stormie Mills exhibition at FORM Gallery was closing on Saturday. We have a terrible record of missing this sort of thing, so I’m pleased that I skipped out on lunch with my golf buddies (scarfing down a sandwich at home instead) to make time for a visit on Wednesday. The image above shows a detail of the velvety floor that was an integral part of this exhibition.\nAfter last week’s beach walk fail I did make time to get out on Tuesday. It was a bit gray and windy, but still worth the drive to clear my head after a day cleaning up my office (tidying and carpet cleaning). Walking on sand is definitely good exercise for me, testing my strength and balance in helpful ways. I’ve not been getting up early enough (or feeling motivated) to go for a run.\nI’ve probably spent too much time in front of the computer again, but I really wanted to have a go at sorting/deleting/archiving my personal email accounts. I did the work email account before I left (in case I lost access, although that hasn’t happened with my adjunct status confirmed). My personal emails were in a terrible state (thousands of unread emails), but they’re a lot better now. It’s not a job I enjoy. Some of the memories old emails trigger aren’t that helpful, and for some reason I find dealing with emails stressful. I vow to keep on top of them from now on… so we’ll have to see how that goes!\nIn more exciting computer work, I set up a Wire-Pod server for my Vector robot (procrastinating on office tidy-up). This deserves its own post, so I won’t go into any more detail here, but I was very surprised how easy it was to do (once I’d managed to upgrade the robot’s firmware).\nGolf was pretty good this week. I had an awful first nine on Wednesday, but rallied well for the second half. Friday I had a great first nine, collapsed in a heap for a few holes, and then recovered. All in all it was pretty encouraging, but I need to spend some time practicing in bunkers to gain confidence (and skill) in getting out reliably! It’s been a bit too windy for me to get out on the water again, but I did buy an impact vest for windsurfing and (if I ever sort out lessons) wing foiling. Trying on neoprene gear is such a pain - great in the water, but awful in changing rooms!\nI joined the Cactus and Succulent Club on Sunday because I was invited to their Christmas party. On the way there I visited a pottery sale (at a spot where a friend of mine is a member). No sign of my friend, but I did find a really pretty vase, which I plan to use for roses from the front garden (because if I don’t bring a few in we don’t really get to enjoy them). I guess I was supposed to be buying presents for people I might need presents for… but this one was definitely for me!\nHad to come straight home after Cactus Club because I won this massive specimen. It’s an Echinopsis oxygona (aka Eyries cactus, Easter lily cactus or sea-urchin cactus).\nMore photos to come when it flowers (if I don’t miss them)!\nStuff I did: Physio Golf x2 Sorted out personal email accounts and setup a Wire-Pod server for Vector Beach walk Got myself fully prepared for time on the water… Plans: Physio Golf x2 Beach walk somewhere different Carry on with the plant/balcony tidy up Finish office tidy up (this might be tough) At least one run? One additional weights session (really, I will try to do this) Get on the water?

I feel that my plans are getting away from me, but I’m trying not to stress. It’s difficult to get into a rhythm and I have too many things I want to do. When I’m not getting up early to play golf… I just don’t get up early enough to do all the things.\n","description":"Still trying to settle into my new life.

I also didn’t go for a run or do a proper weights session, which means the one pull up before the end of the year goal is looking unlikely. I think this is because I’m tiring easily, which is not unexpected given the circumstances.\nThis pretty poor quality image features one of the many kookaburras on the golf course:\nNormally laughing at us, this one was silent as it watched me. I have lots of high quality images of that morning’s golf only because it was the Christmas party fancy dress competition, but I’m not sharing images of people here. We had a good time playing followed by a nice lunch. I could have done without the singing (skits, aaarrgh), but that’s just me.\nTwo rounds of golf on a hilly course is a not inconsiderable amount of exercise (for both body and brain at around four hours of concentration and physical activity). Those trips out this week have been good fun, but probably didn’t help my sleep patterns.\nThis week I also spent too long in front of computers, but I did sort out a lot of things, including one bit of work stuff. It was too windy for me to attempt windsurfing this week (and I admit it, I was relieved to be off the hook). Next week though… well, I might have to give it a go (but I need to upgrade my protective gear first).\nI did begin to spend some time with the plants, which have been neglected over the last few months.

I should actually try to do something more substantial now.

It was last year when I was up in Exmouth that I realised how helpful walking on soft sand might be for building up my strength and confidence walking with no ACL in my left knee. This year’s trip to Exmouth reminded me of that. I’ve been going to the gym and doing lots of other things, but never made time for walks on sand in late 2023 or 2024 up to now. Today I actually went for my first beach walk close to home. Will I continue? Well, that’s the plan!\nIt was not an easy week, but not as difficult as I feared it might be. I’ve been planning my exit from permanent employment for about nine months. In the last three weeks I set aside time to tidy up my digital records, prepare information and resources for colleagues, and take any personal accounts etc off my work computer. For once, I think I did a great job of sorting things out well before the deadline of my last day.\nThat meant I had time to meetup with people for a chat in my last week. It also meant that my leaving event – mini golf with just a few close colleagues – was fun. There were no tasks hanging over my head, and everyone there had a good time (I think).\nWith my last working day on Thursday, followed by my regular Friday golf competition, it was Saturday when I thought things might begin to feel strange. I wasn’t wrong (although Saturdays have been weird for me for a long time). I was too tired to run (and it was too hot by the time I was ready to go anywhere), but accomplishing the beach walk definitely made me feel a lot better.\nStuff I did: Physio Finished up at work (yay)!

This was a collaboration with Dr Gwyneth Peaty to put together the Curtin Net3X MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots.\nThe MOOC has been open ever since then. It’s self-paced and free to access, so anyone can give it a go to see if they’re interested. It is probably somewhat dated now. We’re not given any resources or time to update these things so, while I do fix anything broken when notified, I haven’t been able to put in a lot of time to add new examples or new research to the mix.\nReasons it was fun to work on? Well, it was a great opportunity to set aside some of the formality of academic writing (not that I am that formal in many things I write) while still discussing my favourite topics, robots and communication. It was also good to be working with other people, Gwyneth on the actual course content design, but also the whole MOOC team at Curtin, who were excellent, helpful and made the whole thing a pleasure (in particular the video creation with Brendan, which is not something I feel that comfortable with, in spite of the fact that I’m automatically videoed every time I give a lecture).\nAs Gwyneth has reminded me, these are the robots that started our collaboration in many ways:\nThe humanoid robot is the first robot Gwyneth ever drew for me (I think). I responded with my non-humanoid robot and its thought bubble, “Why is that robot like a human?”. The dog (robot?) came along shortly after. They’ve been through a few changes, some of which you might be able to see in the robotothers Instagram account.\nIt’s great to see that people continue to access the Communicating with Robots and Bots MOOC. I’d love to have more time to engage with people there, make updates, etc, but that’s just not how academia works at the moment. The main hashtag for the MOOC is #curtinnet3x, and there are some additional tags if you’re taking part and posting your ideas for robots, #net3xfirstrobot and #net3xfinalrobot anywhere online.\n","description":"Originally published in 2019 on my old blog, this post has been updated in 2024 to recognise the continued presence of the MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots...","tags":["Teaching","MOOC","Robots","Communication","HMC"],"title":"Communicating with Robots and Bots","uri":"/post/2024/sep/communicating-with-robots-and-bots/"},{"content":"While I know there are lots of sites around the web that are styled using a card type layout, I think that I was probably most influenced by Will Buckingham’s blog…\nI love Will’s writing (books and online), so I visit his website and the associated blog pretty regularly when prompted about a new post via the RSS feed in Feedly.

(2024). Anthropomorphism and its Discontents. Handbook on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. Ed. David Gunkel. Edward Elgar Publishing. (Email me for a copy)\nAI technologies raise many ethical questions. Some of these are associated with technical underpinnings and operation; surveillance, data gathering, and analysis, or copyright and intellectual property issues as can be seen in the widescale processing of published writing or artworks that support generative AI. Alongside this though, the ethics of AI is also questioned because of the ways that people relate to these technologies. Framed as “intelligent,” they foster anthropomorphism, supporting people’s tendency to understand them as humanlike. While some regard anthropomorphism as the only way to interpret and explain the behav- iours of nonhumans; for others it is unscientific, unwarranted, dangerous, and to be avoided at all costs. The designers and developers of AI technologies, including software bots and robots, who embrace anthropomorphic design as an approach that encourages anthropomorphism in human interactants, may therefore be lauded for creating systems that support easy, natural communication with humans or charged with deception and fakery in their efforts to draw people into misguided relationships with technology. Arguments about anthropomorphism and AI technologies can, therefore, be roughly divided into two opposing positions: 1) the desire to create machines that are (or appear to be) humanlike, or 2) the fear of deceiving people into believing that a machine is more humanlike than it is or (some would argue) could ever be.\nAnthropomorphism and its discontents proposes that anthropomorphism is best understood as a process by which people interpret the characteristics and behaviours of nonhuman others as-if partially human-like. It accepts this as the only way for humans to encounter nonhumans—a response shaped by their personal human experience of the world—though other alternatives will be identified and discussed. The definition provided here, while it shares much in common with others (as presented below), is worded to emphasize the partial nature of the interpretive process. Nonhumans are not human and, while they may appear somewhat humanlike at one time or another, there is no need to consider them as being humanlike in any fixed way in order to relate to them. Indeed, nonhumans do not need to be much like humans at all for anthropomorphism to occur and be either helpful or potentially deceitful. Embracing the idea that anthropomorphism can only ever be partial, tempered by recognition that the other may be decidedly not human, opens up possibilities for reconsidering the ethics around human relations with nonhumans including AI technologies.\n","description":"This chapter provides an overview of ideas about anthromoporphism in relation to AI and robots.

(2023). HMC and Theories of Human-Technology Relations. The SAGE Handbook of Human-Machine Communication. Eds. Andrea L. Guzman, Rhonda McEwen \u0026 Steve Jones. Sage. (Free to read or email me for a copy)\nThis chapter draws together a set of relational and ontological approaches that can be used to consider human–technology interactions and relations. Its overarching aim is to explore how communications scholars can theoretically and practically understand people’s direct interactions with machines as human–machine communication (HMC). In general, research into HMC identifies machines as active communicators, not simply as tools enabling human–human communication. This positions machines as active in the world, so theorizing HMC requires a reconsideration of how this activity can be described and analyzed, a move that can be linked with a broader “nonhuman turn” in scholarship that involves “decentering the human” (Grusin, 2015, p. vii). This scholarship depicts “a world populated not by active subjects and passive objects, but by lively and essentially interactive materials, by bodies human and nonhuman” (Bennett, 2015, p. 224). The approaches discussed in this chapter therefore provide ways to recognize nonhuman machines either as members of dynamic systems within which communication emerges, or as active communicators in their own right. These approaches are less widely used than some of the other theories and methods covered elsewhere in this book, but they provide productive ways to rethink how HMC works and how human–machine relations develop over time.\n","description":"This chapter draws together a set of relational and ontological approaches that can be used to consider human–technology interactions and relations as forms of human-machine communication.","tags":["Research","HMC","Robots","Nonhuman","ANT","OOO"],"title":"HMC and Theories of Human–Technology Relations","uri":"/research/2023/hmc-theories/"},{"content":"Journaling is not just a little thing you do to pass the time, to write down your memories—though it can be—it’s a strategy that has helped brilliant, powerful and wise people become better at what they do.\n","title":"Note 3","uri":"/notes/2020/change3/"},{"content":"Sandry, E. (2015). Robots and Communication. Pivot Series. Palgrave Macmillan: Basingstoke, UK. (Email me for a copy)\nOverview Robots and Communication examines human-robot interactions as models of communication. Robots are intriguing communicators because they are created in such a variety of forms. Some are built to appear humanlike, while others are not humanlike in any way, with many different designs existing in the continuum between these extremes. In order to explore human interactions with robots from across this range—from familiar to radically other—this book employs a range of different communication theories and considers how each of them provides a different perspective on what happens when humans and robots meet and interact. The analysis of a variety of human-robot interactions also allows this book to take its findings full circle, to suggest new ways to think about what communication, and being a communicator, entails. Its argument therefore has implications not only for human-robot interaction design, but also for human communication theory and practice more generally.\nThe book is structured in three sections, with an introduction and brief conclusion. The chapter abstracts give a good idea of the material and ideas that I’ve discussed.\nIntroduction In order to prepare the reader for an analysis of human interactions with a wide variety of forms of robot, the introduction first explores what constitutes a robot. It then goes on to outline the different traditions of communication theory that are employed in the book’s analysis. Finally, it explains the structure and scope of the book.\nPART I From Data to Dogs Designing Robots to Communicate with Humans In Chapter 1, the pursuit of humanlike form is analysed in both fictional and real-life contexts. Amongst other justifications, people committed to building humanoid robots argue that these robots are best suited to work in human environments and to communicate with humans. Two paths in humanoid robot design are considered, but both involve understandings of communication that value commonality over difference. This chapter draws on the critiques of the pursuit of sameness found in the work of communication scholars, which is not much discussed in robotics, to destabilise the assumption that humanlike form is the best form for communicative robots.\nHuman-Animal Communication Chapter 2 pauses the book’s consideration of robots to explore human-animal communication, since nonhuman animals are an important part of many people’s lives, acting for some not only as companions, but also as co-workers. Human-animal communication is described in various, often idealised, ways in fiction, but in real-life situations an analysis of human-dog communication demonstrates the importance of attending to the smallest of nonverbal signs over periods of dynamic communication. This chapter highlights the possibilities for humans and animals, in particular dogs, to work together in teams, employing their specific skills to allow the team to perform tasks that neither human nor dog could complete alone. At the end of the chapter is a brief appraisal of the design and development of animal-like robots.\nPART II Communicating with Non-Humanoid Robots Encountering Otherness Chapter 3 concentrates on theorising the encounter between human and robot, identifying moments when communication occurs, often using nonverbal communication channels at least initially. It discusses two versions of the Autonomous Light Air Vessels (ALAVs) art installation, within which blimp-like robots interact with one another and with visitors. It also extends Levinas’ conception of self-other encounters to consider nonhumans, including robots, in order to consider how communication can be understood to draw the self and other into proximity while retaining the differences between them.\nStories and Dances In Chapter 4, the discussion moves beyond the initial encounter, to consider how dynamic interactions support communication with robots where those communications are also framed by a backstory. The focus is on how interactions can be understood in terms of both dialogue and overlapping continuous systems of interchange. Levinas’ theory is further extended in this chapter, to highlight the interruptions in being and in saying that occur in interactions with Fish and Bird, the wheelchair-like robots discussed throughout the chapter.\nCollaboration and Trust Chapter 5 considers what happens when humans and robots learn to complete tasks together as a team. In particular, it discusses human interactions with AUR, the robotic desk lamp. In this example, elements of verbal and nonverbal communication are combined in a dynamic communication that involves paying attention to each other as well as to the task at hand. The chapter considers communication with AUR in terms of a companion species relation, drawing on the discussion of human-dog agility teams in Chapter 2.\nPART III Rethinking Robots and Communication Humans, Animals and Machines Chapter 6 considers the implications of human communication with nonhuman others for the categories human, animal and machine. It argues that, while the boundaries between these types of being are becoming increasingly blurred, they are nevertheless still meaningful. The chapter goes on to consider ways of assigning agency to nonhuman others on the basis of their activity in situations, while also recognising the difference between human activities and nonhuman activities.\nCommunication, Individuals and Systems Chapter 7 concentrates on exploring some ideas about the relationship between individuals and systems in thinking about communication. It discusses long-term interactions with robots outside of laboratories and art installations, identifying the value of respect and trust in collaborative partnerships with robots. This is developed into a consideration of how responsibility is shared across collaborative teams, even when the team members are in an asymmetrical relationship.\nConclusion The short conclusion to this book explains the basis for its somewhat eclectic analysis, which uses a range of traditions of communication theory, as well as considering the overarching conceptions of discrete state and dynamic systems methodologies.\nI tried to make Robots and Communication appealing, whether the reader wants to find out more about communication theory and approaches to analysing communicative situations, or is interested in robotics and wants to explore the possibilities of human-robot interactions with a wide range of different forms of robot.\n","description":"Robots and Communication is a book examining human-robot interactions as models of communication.","tags":["Research","Communication","HMC","Robots"],"title":"Robots and Communication","uri":"/research/2015/robots-and-communication/"}]
