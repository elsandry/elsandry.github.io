[{"content":"My first ever weeknotes post following a momentous week - finishing up my work as a Senior Lecturer…\nI took this image of an iron steer decorating a gate on the way back from a long-planned beach walk. When I say long-planned I’m not kidding. It was last year when I was up in Exmouth that I realised how helpful walking on soft sand might be for building up my strength and confidence walking with no ACL in my left knee. This year’s trip to Exmouth reminded me of that. I’ve been going to the gym and doing lots of other things, but never made time for walks on sand in late 2023 or 2024 up to now. Today I actually went for my first beach walk close to home. Will I continue? Well, that’s the plan!\nIt was not an easy week, but not as difficult as I feared it might be. I’ve been planning my exit from permanent employment for about nine months. In the last three weeks I set aside time to tidy up my digital records, prepare information and resources for colleagues, and take any personal accounts etc off my work computer. For once, I think I did a great job of sorting things out well before the deadline of my last day.\nThat meant I had time to meetup with people for a chat in my last week. It also meant that my leaving event – mini golf with just a few close colleagues – was fun. There were no tasks hanging over my head, and everyone there had a good time (I think).\nWith my last working day on Thursday, followed by my regular Friday golf competition, it was Saturday when I thought things might begin to feel strange. I wasn’t wrong (although Saturdays have been weird for me for a long time). I was too tired to run (and it was too hot by the time I was ready to go anywhere), but accomplishing the beach walk definitely made me feel a lot better.\nStuff I did: Physio Finished up at work (yay)! Golf x2 Beach walk (!) Plans: Setup custom domain for this site Tidy up what I have here so I can release this to the world Physio Golf x2 Beach walk somewhere different At least one run? One additional weights session (oh, I’m so bad at doing this on the reg) Get on the water? (wind, weather and energy allowing) I’m not sure how next week will actually pan out. I’m pretty tired. I know I have too many plans. I’m a bit hyper. The key will be to do something, not just think about everything!\nI really do need to write an overdue abstract for a piece of writing, but that’s work (sort of work), so I’m having a few issues scheduling time in my first week of freedom (sorry editors).\n","description":"My first ever weeknotes post following a momentous week - finishing up my work as a Senior Lecturer...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 17-23 November 2024","uri":"/post/2024/nov/weeknotes-24/"},{"content":"Originally published in 2019 on my old blog, this post has been updated in 2024 to recognise the continued presence of the MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots…\nOne of the most enjoyable pieces of writing (and collating of research, videos, news articles, images etc) about robots I have done occurred back in 2019. This was a collaboration with Dr Gwyneth Peaty to put together the Curtin Net3X MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots.\nThe MOOC has been open ever since then. It’s self-paced and free to access, so anyone can give it a go to see if they’re interested. It is probably somewhat dated now. We’re not given any resources or time to update these things so, while I do fix anything broken when notified, I haven’t been able to put in a lot of time to add new examples or new research to the mix.\nReasons it was fun to work on? Well, it was a great opportunity to set aside some of the formality of academic writing (not that I am that formal in many things I write) while still discussing my favourite topics, robots and communication. It was also good to be working with other people, Gwyneth on the actual course content design, but also the whole MOOC team at Curtin, who were excellent, helpful and made the whole thing a pleasure (in particular the video creation with Brendan, which is not something I feel that comfortable with, in spite of the fact that I’m automatically videoed every time I give a lecture).\nAs Gwyneth has reminded me, these are the robots that started our collaboration in many ways:\nThe humanoid robot is the first robot Gwyneth ever drew for me (I think). I responded with my non-humanoid robot and its thought bubble, “Why is that robot like a human?”. The dog (robot?) came along shortly after. They’ve been through a few changes, some of which you might be able to see in the sidebar posted through the robotothers Instagram account.\nIt’s great to see that people continue to access the Communicating with Robots and Bots MOOC. I’d love to have more time to engage with people there, make updates, etc, but that’s just not how academia works at the moment. The main hashtag for the MOOC is #curtinnet3x, and there are some additional tags if you’re taking part and posting your ideas for robots, #net3xfirstrobot and #net3xfinalrobot anywhere online.\n","description":"Originally published in 2019 on my old blog, this post has been updated in 2024 to recognise the continued presence of the MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots...","tags":["Teaching","MOOC","Robots","Communication","HMC"],"title":"Communicating with Robots and Bots","uri":"/post/2024/sep/communicating-with-robots-and-bots/"},{"content":"While I know there are lots of sites around the web that are styled using a card type layout, I think that I was probably most influenced by Will Buckingham’s blog…\nI love Will’s writing (books and online), so I visit his website and the associated blog pretty regularly when prompted about a new post via the RSS feed in Feedly. I always admire the way the site looks (the image for this post shows a screenshot), but now, while trying to implement something similar for myself, I wonder if image choice will sometimes hold me back from writing at all.\nThis form of presentation is familiar to me as a reader, but not as a writer, and I’m also still not sure how well I’ll get on with the rather image-heavy look and feel up front, before what might be quite a substantial piece of writing behind (once you click through).\nMy old site was what I think of as a “traditional” blog. The home page was straight into the reverse chronological feed of full posts, not a sort of visual summary page of the type I’m trialling here. I do have the option to use that type of theme here too (there are a few Hugo themes that support that style). I wonder if more traditional will encourage me to write more… or less. With the web now being very reliant on images to gain attention, even for people that you are hoping will primarily become readers of text, I thought that the card-style theme would work well.\nTo be honest, I think I was also trying to push myself out of my comfort zone, or at the very least make a definitive move away from the way that the old Zigzaggery used to look.\nWhat do you think?\nYou can leave a comment below or you can chat with me on Mastodon instead, if that’s possible for you.\n","description":"While I know there are lots of sites around the web that are styled using a card type layout, I think that I was probably most influenced by Will Buckingham's blog...","tags":["hugo","site"],"title":"Still not sure about the card style for this site","uri":"/post/2024/sep/still-not-sure/"},{"content":"Creating this site takes time.

Some of these are associated with technical underpinnings and operation; surveillance, data gathering, and analysis, or copyright and intellectual property issues as can be seen in the widescale processing of published writing or artworks that support generative AI. Alongside this though, the ethics of AI is also questioned because of the ways that people relate to these technologies. Framed as “intelligent,” they foster anthropomorphism, supporting people’s tendency to understand them as humanlike. While some regard anthropomorphism as the only way to interpret and explain the behav- iours of nonhumans; for others it is unscientific, unwarranted, dangerous, and to be avoided at all costs. The designers and developers of AI technologies, including software bots and robots, who embrace anthropomorphic design as an approach that encourages anthropomorphism in human interactants, may therefore be lauded for creating systems that support easy, natural communication with humans or charged with deception and fakery in their efforts to draw people into misguided relationships with technology. Arguments about anthropomorphism and AI technologies can, therefore, be roughly divided into two opposing positions: 1) the desire to create machines that are (or appear to be) humanlike, or 2) the fear of deceiving people into believing that a machine is more humanlike than it is or (some would argue) could ever be.\nAnthropomorphism and its discontents proposes that anthropomorphism is best understood as a process by which people interpret the characteristics and behaviours of nonhuman others as-if partially human-like. It accepts this as the only way for humans to encounter nonhumans—a response shaped by their personal human experience of the world—though other alternatives will be identified and discussed. The definition provided here, while it shares much in common with others (as presented below), is worded to emphasize the partial nature of the interpretive process. Nonhumans are not human and, while they may appear somewhat humanlike at one time or another, there is no need to consider them as being humanlike in any fixed way in order to relate to them. Indeed, nonhumans do not need to be much like humans at all for anthropomorphism to occur and be either helpful or potentially deceitful. Embracing the idea that anthropomorphism can only ever be partial, tempered by recognition that the other may be decidedly not human, opens up possibilities for reconsidering the ethics around human relations with nonhumans including AI technologies.\n","description":"This chapter provides an overview of ideas about anthromoporphism in relation to AI and robots.

Robots are intriguing communicators because they are created in such a variety of forms. Some are built to appear humanlike, while others are not humanlike in any way, with many different designs existing in the continuum between these extremes. In order to explore human interactions with robots from across this range—from familiar to radically other—this book employs a range of different communication theories and considers how each of them provides a different perspective on what happens when humans and robots meet and interact. The analysis of a variety of human-robot interactions also allows this book to take its findings full circle, to suggest new ways to think about what communication, and being a communicator, entails. Its argument therefore has implications not only for human-robot interaction design, but also for human communication theory and practice more generally.\nThe book is structured in three sections, with an introduction and brief conclusion. These are the chapter abstracts, which give a good idea of the material and ideas that I’ve discussed:\nIntroduction In order to prepare the reader for an analysis of human interactions with a wide variety of forms of robot, the introduction first explores what constitutes a robot. It then goes on to outline the different traditions of communication theory that are employed in the book’s analysis. Finally, it explains the structure and scope of the book.\nPART I From Data to Dogs Designing Robots to Communicate with Humans In Chapter 1, the pursuit of humanlike form is analysed in both fictional and real-life contexts. Amongst other justifications, people committed to building humanoid robots argue that these robots are best suited to work in human environments and to communicate with humans. Two paths in humanoid robot design are considered, but both involve understandings of communication that value commonality over difference. This chapter draws on the critiques of the pursuit of sameness found in the work of communication scholars, which is not much discussed in robotics, to destabilise the assumption that humanlike form is the best form for communicative robots.\nHuman-Animal Communication Chapter 2 pauses the book’s consideration of robots to explore human-animal communication, since nonhuman animals are an important part of many people’s lives, acting for some not only as companions, but also as co-workers. Human-animal communication is described in various, often idealised, ways in fiction, but in real-life situations an analysis of human-dog communication demonstrates the importance of attending to the smallest of nonverbal signs over periods of dynamic communication. This chapter highlights the possibilities for humans and animals, in particular dogs, to work together in teams, employing their specific skills to allow the team to perform tasks that neither human nor dog could complete alone. At the end of the chapter is a brief appraisal of the design and development of animal-like robots.\nPART II Communicating with Non-Humanoid Robots Encountering Otherness Chapter 3 concentrates on theorising the encounter between human and robot, identifying moments when communication occurs, often using nonverbal communication channels at least initially. It discusses two versions of the Autonomous Light Air Vessels (ALAVs) art installation, within which blimp-like robots interact with one another and with visitors. It also extends Levinas’ conception of self-other encounters to consider nonhumans, including robots, in order to consider how communication can be understood to draw the self and other into proximity while retaining the differences between them.\nStories and Dances In Chapter 4, the discussion moves beyond the initial encounter, to consider how dynamic interactions support communication with robots where those communications are also framed by a backstory. The focus is on how interactions can be understood in terms of both dialogue and overlapping continuous systems of interchange. Levinas’ theory is further extended in this chapter, to highlight the interruptions in being and in saying that occur in interactions with Fish and Bird, the wheelchair-like robots discussed throughout the chapter.\nCollaboration and Trust Chapter 5 considers what happens when humans and robots learn to complete tasks together as a team. In particular, it discusses human interactions with AUR, the robotic desk lamp. In this example, elements of verbal and nonverbal communication are combined in a dynamic communication that involves paying attention to each other as well as to the task at hand. The chapter considers communication with AUR in terms of a companion species relation, drawing on the discussion of human-dog agility teams in Chapter 2.\nPART III Rethinking Robots and Communication Humans, Animals and Machines Chapter 6 considers the implications of human communication with nonhuman others for the categories human, animal and machine. It argues that, while the boundaries between these types of being are becoming increasingly blurred, they are nevertheless still meaningful. The chapter goes on to consider ways of assigning agency to nonhuman others on the basis of their activity in situations, while also recognising the difference between human activities and nonhuman activities.\nCommunication, Individuals and Systems Chapter 7 concentrates on exploring some ideas about the relationship between individuals and systems in thinking about communication. It discusses long-term interactions with robots outside of laboratories and art installations, identifying the value of respect and trust in collaborative partnerships with robots. This is developed into a consideration of how responsibility is shared across collaborative teams, even when the team members are in an asymmetrical relationship.\nConclusion The short conclusion to this book explains the basis for its somewhat eclectic analysis, which uses a range of traditions of communication theory, as well as considering the overarching conceptions of discrete state and dynamic systems methodologies.\nI tried to make Robots and Communication appealing, whether the reader wants to find out more about communication theory and approaches to analysing communicative situations, or is interested in robotics and wants to explore the possibilities of human-robot interactions with a wide range of different forms of robot.\n","description":"Robots and Communication is a book examining human-robot interactions as models of communication.","tags":["Research","Communication","HMC","Robots"],"title":"Robots and Communication","uri":"/collections/2024/robots-and-communication/"}]
