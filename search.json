[{"content":"Not a fantastic week, with the car breaking down (and me with it, to some extent)…\n…but I’m feeling much better and the car is fixed, so things are looking up again.\nThis week’s picture is a view looking up at our tree. I’ve been thinking of writing at least one post that documents all of the tree’s inhabitants over a day. The birds often seem to have booked shifts up there, with arguments breaking out when a group overstay their timeslot. Today though (the day after I should have written this weeknote) it has been the preserve of the raven(s).\nReading: I’ve paused my re-reading of the Silo trilogy by Hugh Howey because the story has deviated from the television series quite a bit at this point. I realised I was getting confused with some characters experiencing very different lives across the two narratives. Moving on to Robert J. Sawyer’s Starplex involves a change of pace to what some people (including Sawyer) describe as “hard” science fiction (although I’m not sure I agree - maybe it depends on how you read the story and the details to which you pay attention).\nI’ve not done much more reading of New Happy. I’ve stalled a bit (as I often do on this genre of book, although, as the author says, this isn’t really traditional “self-help” since it isn’t just about helping the self alone, rather about helping the self via helping society and other people. One thing I have been trying to track is daily emotions/moods, but I’ve already discarded the resource the New Happy website offers to design my own more flexible and artistic method. I’m going to have to write a post about that once I’ve worked on it a bit more.\nGolf: Two rounds of competition, with no practice… one good and one half good (and then very bad) where good and bad is not just judged via scoring, but also by ability to hit the ball pretty much at all in the right direction. There is work to be done here, but this week was not the week to be doing that work.\nExercise: I bailed on home weights… again. I was exhausted from my over-anxious reaction to the car breaking down, organising the garage, a tow, and the repairs. It all went fine, but it rattled me when I had to drive home in limp mode (because I realised it could have been a lot more scary and dangerous if I hadn’t been on local small streets). My physio session at the gym was good though.\nAlso, still no running. I will get there eventually.\nFood: We did eat well, but I self-sabotaged by drinking wine too many nights. I didn’t have a lot, but these days it can result in less restful sleep (already put into disarray by my stress).\nGarden: Managed about a third of a bin with couch grass and a massive deceased rose bush root system.\nMy plans for the garden are developing in my head, but not in physical space! Can’t yet work out if the rocks in the back garden bird bath are really helpful, so no more rocks have been purchased yet.\nAdventure: No more windsurfing, no other watersports. I think I will book a single lesson for wingfoiling in the next few weeks because this will set me up for doing meaningful practice on the standup paddleboard with additional fins (discussed last week).\nSewing: All the material is washed and ready to go, but I’ve not been in the mood to sew. I’ve decided what table to buy to setup in my office as a sewing/art desk. I think having a dedicated space will make it much easier to commit time to projects (without feeling hurried by the fact that I’ve taken over the dining table). My main desk is sit-stand and very much for computers and possibly writing. I need a bigger flat space for patterns, cutting material, the sewing machine and overlocker, but also for any art projects I might ever get around too as well.\nThree ideas: Windsurfing… try again (if the wind is around on a day I can go) Book that winging lesson (so I am confident to practice on my own with the fin attachment for the standup paddleboard) Plant something (moved from last week this this week, because I need to start sometime) I am going to have to send some work-related emails next week… and I’m not looking forward to that, but it needs to be done and off my mind.\n","description":"Not a fantastic week, with the car breaking down (and me with it, to some extent)...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 10 - 16 February 2025","uri":"/post/2025/feb/weeknotes-16/"},{"content":"Hot and humid days have meant I was lacking in energy, but I did flop about in the ocean with a windsurfer two more times. I met this shield bug in the park where I recovered the second time…\n…very closely matched with the new playground’s tarmac.\nI sailed for about 20 metres, but I’m not going further until I can reliably turn the kit around, get back up and sail in the opposite direction. This is a little frustrating, but definitely a sensible call.\nReading: The re-reading of the Silo trilogy by Hugh Howey continues. I prefer the books to the television series in terms of how the story events and characters are portrayed. This isn’t surprising, since I almost always prefer what I imagine and the way that stories work in written narratives (given the option).\nI’ve also been reading New Happy having finally coughed up for a copy of the paperback. I’ve been reading their newsletters and collecting (but never remembering to listen to) the podcasts for a while. Now I’ve got more time to think about stuff it seemed worth reading the actual book and seeing if it might be helpful. The jury is still out… but I’m considering how I might use (and benefit from) modified activities based on the book and other resources. If I get anywhere I’ll write a full post about this.\nGolf: Just social golf this week. Nine on my home course and nine somewhere new. Both times I played ok, with good shots and bad. My driving is off at the moment, so I think I need to just hit some balls on the range to relax my swing and practice a reproduceable setup. That’s the plan anyway, because I’ll be back to two competition rounds middle and end of next week.\nExercise: I bailed on home weights, mostly because I was pretty tired from the beach and attempts to windsurf, but also because I still refuse to put a time aside in my calendar to help ensure that sessions actually happen. My physio session at the gym was good this week. I felt strong, balanced and in control of all the exercises.\nAlthough it is turning cooler now, continuing for the next few days, I don’t know if the humidity will ease enough for me to go running. I did go for a walk today (but I got very hot).\nFood: Doing our best with assorted meat and salad in the heat, with one quiche (from the shop). I think we end up eating a lot less fibre than when we’re cooking vegetables, given the often simple salads we like (and can be bothered to make). I don’t know if I’m motivated enough to do better though!\nGarden: Managed to half fill the bin in the heat. Trimmed the lemon tree, already stripped of fruit because of the Queensland fruit fly infiltration locally which the state is trying to eradicate. With no fruit to support the tree has been putting out new shoots (but most are vertical, which is not what you want).\nI did a bit more research into varieties of natives to plant and other things I might like to fill gaps in the garden. Spent some time looking at what was available in local garden centres this week. I found some possibles, but I’m not feeling confident enough to buy and plant at the moment. I will try to do some small things first (and see how much success I have with those) before getting into anything larger or more extensive.\nThe bird baths are visited regularly and this morning I went to buy some rocks to put in the one out the back to see if the smaller birds prefer having a shallower section and somewhere to perch. If that works out then I’ll do the same for the front.\nCactus repotting requirements continue to be the job I am putting off. They are dangerous beasts and I fear I will be stabbed!\nAdventure: I went (almost) windsurfing two more times! The second time I actually did sail a bit (but as I noted above, I need to build my skills before heading off further from shore).\nLast year I researched a fin kit that can be used to allow you to use a wing on a standup paddleboard and sail properly (ie allow you to go up and down wind, rather than just sliding off the wind, which is what happens without a centreboard). I couldn’t find anyone with stock in my state at that time, but I found it this week. Looking foward to trying this (although I don’t really have much of a clue what I’m doing with the wing having just stood on the beach getting the feel of it thus far). Maybe one lesson might help and then I can take my time practicing with my own equipment before attempting more lessons with the foil?\nSewing: The skirt I made last week has been worn almost every day, so I’m clearly pretty happy with the pattern. My last post gave a lot more information about the small alterations I’ll make before sewing another. This week I bought more material (and also realised just how much of a stash I have from over a year ago when I was about to make lots of things and then stopped because work took over and I got overwhelmed and demoralised). Not all of my material pile is for skirts, but quite a bit is… maybe for this pattern and another I used a while back (that also needs alteration for fit).\nThree ideas: Windsurfing… keep trying (maybe at the river, or maybe the ocean, we’ll see) Try out the fin attachment for the standup paddleboard with my wing (?? depends on many things, not all of which are in my control) Plant something (?!) This week I handwrote a set of notes/mindmap for potential research paper ideas, but did not return to them (which I felt I would if I was inspired, so likely was not). There might be something else I could write about that popped up recently in the news, but it might just turn into a blog post rather than a journal article. More on that another time (whatever I do).\n","description":"Hot and humid days have meant I was lacking in energy, but I did flop about in the ocean with a windsurfer two more times.

I like the way the semi-patched pockets break up the plain skirt. The patterned skirts will have pockets set into the side seams and waistband (the latter to improve weight distribution, see below) instead.\nThe pattern I drafted myself was based on the skirts I’ve owned for ages (and worn to death). There are just four pieces to the pattern: front (cut on fold), back (cut on fold), waistband (cut on fold) and pocket (x2 for semi-patched and x4 of a different shape for the inset version).\nThe result was too big at first (because I always add too much ease up front and then realise that things can be more fitted with a better line, yet still comfortable to wear). I tacked the pieces together with my sewing machine, noted the sizing issue, and then… with much trepidation… got out my overlocker (serger) for the first time and used that to both re-stich and cut down the side seams (and the pockets in fact, because these were also too large so could take the same reduction). Most things I read about overlockers imply you should practice with them, take your time to learn, etc, but I just jumped straight in… and it was fine on the cheap, linen/cotton fabric I was using!\nThe overlocker is a revelation. The seams and finish are just great. I guess I might have issues in the future if I don’t take a bit more care to practice with stretch materials, for example. Then there’s the whole question of re-threading… although if you pay attention then you can cheat by pulling the new threads through the machine after knotting them to the existing ones.\nI ended up using this simple method to attach the waistband, rather than the more complex one I learnt ages ago. With the overlocker to finish the edge the simple method works well and allows for adjustment.\nThe inset pocket alteration I’ll be using for the patterned skirts took some time to research. I found I’d saved a reel that described what I wanted. As the video explains, the advantage of this design is that it distributes the weight of the contents into the waistband, thus allowing you to put your heavy phone (or whatever) into the pocket without destroying the line of the skirt. The drafting information took a while to find, and then an example where it is used for a skirt took even longer to locate, but it all makes sense now.\nSo… once I have resized the pattern itself (because I’ve been too busy wearing my skirt and doing other things to get around to that yet) and made a few other alterations (mainly a wider waistband to accommodate wider elastic for a flatter finish and the alternate inset pocket piece) I’ll be making more. I’ve got material for at least two more plain in other colours and two patterned. Finally I will have all the skirts I have ever wanted.\n","description":"Since I can't find skirts I like, and my wear-all-the-time skirts are wearing out too much to fix easily, I have finally drafted a pattern and made my own...","tags":["Sewing"],"title":"Drafting patterns and sewing skirts","uri":"/post/2025/feb/drafting-and-sewing-skirts/"},{"content":"Back down to the windsurfing beach this week and I had a go this time…\n…but it didn’t go great!\nOn a positive note, all my new kit fitted well, I was very comfortable and my leg brace felt fine (so fine that really I didn’t notice it at all unless I was kneeling on the board trying to uphaul). Negatives? I was too scared to put up a large enough sail for the conditions (in case more wind came in while I was out), so I struggled to beach and water start. This was the reason for attempting to uphaul, but in spite of my balance being way better than it has ever been, I couldn’t handle the chop.\nThe beach was nice though, as you can see from the header image for this post.\nMaybe next time will go better (and I might try the river with a larger board).\nReading: I’ve been trying, and failing, to read some books recently. We’ve had a few false starts trying new (to us) science fiction authors. D gave up and returned to an old set of fantasy books, but I’d forgotten how disturbing I find torture (a feature mainly of the first of the novels in the trilogy). I’ve read this set of books before, and was ok, but it doesn’t make me comfortable now. I stopped.\nI’ve decided instead to re-read the Silo trilogy by Hugh Howey. We’re on to the second season of the television adaptation and I’ve been wondering how similar the storylines are (given the need often to make things quite different to work for the audiovisual watcher-listener rather than the reader). So far I’m finding that the stories match in terms of events, but that some characters are more dominant in the television adaptation. Explanations for why things happen are also a little different. I’m not sure if I’ll need to halt my reading to avoid overtaking the viewing experience.\nGolf: I’m playing more consistently again. It’s remarkable how much easier it is to play well when practicing as opposed to taking part in competition though. There’s less pressure and often more time to get into a rhythym. It’s the rhythym of the walking and the shots that really makes a difference for me. As soon as I need to speed up (because I, or someone I’m playing with, has hit issues and we’re holding up the field) my play often goes off the rails!\nI’ve continued to think about a practice schedule. I’ve got some ideas for what to do at the driving range now (and I’ve been saving short simple tips as I see them on social media, this being one of the reasons that I don’t want to leave social media behind completely atm).\nExercise: I managed 25 minutes of home weights on top of my physio session this week, which was better than I’ve ever done before (or maybe since the first few months when I was in recovery from my injury so was a bit more motivated to do all the at home exercises regularly). This is good. I’m feeling strong and its paying off in terms of how well I’m going with golf, gardening and (almost) windsurfing.\nStill contemplating the idea of a run. Maybe the week after next when it really might be cooler.\nFood: We’re continuing to eat pretty well. It turns out that steak, red wine and cheese can be a bit much these days! (I slept so badly that the next day I had to take it easy.) No hangover, just soooo tired.\nGarden: Filled the bin again, although I thought it’d be a struggle. I took out an aloe that was trying to make it into the pool (before it got so big as to be a two person job). I also trimmed back some other succulent ground cover.\nI did a bunch of research into varieties of natives that are good for insects and birds. I’m thinking of planting some large natives where our front lawn is struggling, turning that square into bush (with the larger plants meaning we can just cut the grass back underneath rather than attempting to take what remains out completely).\nThe bird baths are still filled on the reg, but I haven’t seen much action. The pigeons seem to like the front garden now though.\nOMG. The large cactus… and Milligan (a succulent with the vicious spikes out front) both need repotting.\nAdventure: I almost went windsurfing! Not sure about wingfoiling now. Confused. Here’s a seagull I saw fly over when I was sitting on the beach recovering:\nSewing: I made a skirt. It’s effectively a wearable toile of the pattern I made for myself. I had to alter it a bit as I made it, with that job made a lot easier by initial tacking with the sewing machine before using my new overlocker to cut it down to size!\nThe overlocker is magic. The finish is great. I’m looking forward to making my next tee-shirt now, because it’ll make stretch fabric so much easier to work and the final product much more professional.\nThree ideas: Windsurfing… try again (maybe hire a big board and go to the river, or just go to the river for a less choppy experience) Buy really nice fabric for skirt no. 2 See if I can locate plants The Work section has not made a reappearance, in spite of the fact that it should have… read into that what you will.\n","description":"Back down to the windsurfing beach this week and I had a go this time...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 27 January - 2 February 2025","uri":"/post/2025/feb/weeknotes-02/"},{"content":"Don’t get too excited. I don’t kitesurf (since a scary experience just after I finished lessons) and I haven’t yet managed to get back on the windsurfer. I did make it to the beach…\n…but it was way too windy and choppy for me to want to go out!\nThis week’s image shows just a few of the kites that were up. There was a competition in the bay, but it’s often this busy anyway. D had a good sail, but even he said it was challenging. Glad I stayed on dry land!\nMaybe tomorrow?\nReading: I finished the last of the Detective Kindaichi Mysteries by Seishi Yokomizo earlier this week. It followed the same pattern, with quite a few deaths and a convoluted story of interpersonal relationships. This series brought back memories of reading detective novels as a teenager. Although I read a lot of contemporary fiction at that time, I also went through my parents collection of Penguin paperbacks. Dorothy L. Sayers and Ngaio Marsh were two of my favourite authors. Now I feel like going back to revisit those novels, although I wonder if I’d enjoy them as much now.\nI’ve moved on to other novels (not thrillers). In terms of nonfiction… well, I’d like to get hold of a book I’ve seen on supporting black cockatoos in gardens (although I’m interested in supporting birdlife more broadly too), and I might even be interested in a research-related book!?\nGolf: I’m playing ok at the moment, but very up and down. It has been hot, so I’ve not been practising. I’d really like to spend time on some basic drills and maybe get some coaching again. It’s pretty much impossible to be completely consistent, but with some practice I really should be able to make my rounds less of a rollercoaster. I know I should spend at least some of that time on putting, but it’s my least favourite thing to work on!\nAs it gets a bit cooler I’m going to work out a practice schedule for myself. Setup and pre-shot routine will be the first things to get more comfortable with (across everything, from driving to putting). I could try changing my grip again (but that’d really stuff everything up and I might just end up with sore fingers again, so maybe not a good idea).\nExercise: I managed 20 minutes of home weights on top of my physio session and it was enough to make me sore the next day, so I did well this week. I’d like to get to either one additional 30 minute session, or a couple of shorter ones each week ideally. I did some research (ie I used my academic library access) on osteoporosis and exercise, which reinforced the idea that weights at least a couple of times a week would be good for me. It’s not enough to jump around (contra what you might see on social media). I’d provide the research paper links here, but unfortunately they were all paywalled, so there’s not much point sharing. Just ask if you’re interested in knowing more.\nI contemplated going for a run this week, but it was hot and humid. I think I made the right call not going. I do feel as if I’ll get back into it when it’s cooler now.\nFood: We’re continuing to do ok in terms of eating. Had one takeaway this week, which helped because I’ve been struggling to feel enthused about cooking, in particular when it’s been hot.\nGarden: This week I filled the bin with couch grass from the front garden. It had got out of hand and, even though it is almost impossible to remove compeltely, the bed looks a lot better now. I’ll just need to keep removing it when it sprouts (trying to dig out as many of the runners as I can). Once I’ve done that for a few weeks I might consider planting some more succulents or maybe natives (for birds etc). Whatever I plant needs to be drought tolerant (given no reticulation in that bed and my irregular hand waterering schedule to contend with)!\nI bought two simple terracotta birdbath bowls, one for the front and one for the back. It was forecast to be hot and I wanted to give the birds somewhere to cool down and take a drink (also lizards, but I don’t think we have that many at the moment). Both have definitely seen some action. I saw a raven drinking and cooling its feet out the front and a wagtail having a bath out the back.\nI did buy a pot for the large cactus, but have not attempted to move it yet!\nAdventure: I got no further on organising wingfoiling lessons. Maybe that’ll be easier if I have a try at windsurfing again when its a bit less ballistic?\nSewing: The skirt-making project I’ve been planning for weeks is in progress! It’s imperative that I get this pattern to work - although I’m very aware the first attempt might not be successful. More on this next week (I hope).\nThree ideas: Windsurfing… and/or get onto someone about wingfoiling lessons Finish (?) the skirt, or at least get somewhere Set aside 15 minutes to outline a potential journal article argument (or pull the pin officially) The Work section was replaced with Sewing this week, hence the article argument appearing again in the three ideas list. I seem to have no desire to do research writing work at all. Suddenly all I wanted to do was to cut material and sew. Weird.\n","description":"Don't get too excited.

It might have something to do with wanting to feel I’m improving my golf game (but still only managing to play well for half any given round). It might be because, while I do want to fulfil my writing commitments this month and next, I don’t actually want to do the writing. Then again, it could be my indecision around organising wing foiling lessons and the fact that I’ve not decided to go windsurfing yet this year. I’m scared - I know that, know why and respect that feeling - but I would still like to give these things a go (again).\nThis week’s image is related to preparing for the heat now and all through next week: reflections in the pool whose cooling embrace will be needed in just a few moments.\nReading: Nearing the end of the Detective Kindaichi Mysteries by Seishi Yokomizo series now, I’m still enjoying the gentle narratives, well drawn characters and many dead bodies often artfully presented. The stories always feature a number of missed opportunities to find out key pieces of information that would prevent more death.\nI’m still not reading anything else, but I’m happy to be finding more and more interesting personal blogs and people to follow on Mastodon.\nGolf: My golf was ok on Wednesday and poor on Friday (after a great start). My mood on Wednesday was upbeat. I did a bit of practice before I left after lunch. Friday though… Well, I got quite (read: incandescently) angry with myself (although I don’t think my playing partners noticed the level of rage). I was still hitting some good shots, but there were a few things I did wrong repeatedly, in spite of making adjustments that should have helped. I could not putt (with an issue that plagued me the whole round, but that I failed to correct effectively at all). Again, I did more practice before leaving for home, and that did make me feel a bit better (but not much).\nExercise: I managed 5 minutes of additional weights on top of my physio session. Hmm… must do better (yet another irritation).\nRunning? Not in the wind (and now, not in the heat).\nFood: We’re doing pretty well in terms of eating atm. I’m quite enjoying it most of the time, with the occasional issue (when I’ve already been feeling peeved).\nGarden: My dedication to getting stuff done in the garden - watering things and sorting out pots, cuttings and planning future changes - is going well. I’m actually enjoying this a lot!\nI continued to put off sorting out the huge cactus with a new pot and it took matters into its own… spines. Part of it fell off, so I potted up the pups and cut the large section off clean (above any rot/dry die back) to see if I can pot that up when it develops a callus.\nAdventure: I had already located three potential places for wingfoiling lessons by the end of last week. I think I’ll go with one of the two offering individual lessons (more expensive, but probably worth it). Now I’m having issues getting down to making a booking. I’m thinking of emailing them to see how responsive they are and what they think about teaching someone who is using a hinged knee brace to protect a permanently injured knee (no ACL on that side, no pain but potentially unstable if twisted).\nThe thought of skiing (or maybe snowboarding) at some point this year continues to be in my head (and not always in a positive way, but I don’t want to just give up).\nWork (a new section): I did manage to set the timer for 15 minutes twice this week and actually considered the most urgent writing project on the books for about two hours in the end. I can write this, but only if I work out what I want to argue in the next few days (making the article different from everything I’ve already said, but also fun to write, with the latter being key to me now). The deadline is looming dangerously close.\nThree ideas: Email two of the possible wingfoiling teachers about lessons for someone with a knee brace Find and buy a cactus pot Set aside 15 minutes to outline a potential journal article argument I don’t think anyone reads these weeknotes, but if they do then they might notice that they’re always posted a day (or even two days) late. This is in part because I’m struggling to feel I’m moving forward, in particular with the adventure/ideas aspects of my life, so I don’t want to write up what feels like a failure (until I’ve had a chance to move at least one of the things along ready to report on in the next week). I guess that means the accountability aspect of writing these is almost working!?!?\n","description":"For some reason this was a week dominated by irritability...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 13 - 19 January 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jan/weeknotes-19/"},{"content":"A week in which it turned out that watching golf (ie walking the course with the players) is just as tiring physically as playing golf…\nThis week there was a professional competition at my club, so I got the chance to play another great local course for free (because we get offered alternative tee times elsewhere when we can’t access our own course). However, this didn’t mean I wasn’t walking my own course, because I followed the golf competition for three days (well the pro am for one, then Friday and Sunday of the actual comp)! The cover image shows a view across the 18th hole.\nOther than that, this week was much like last week: gardening, cooking and reading.\nReading: Still working through the Detective Kindaichi Mysteries by Seishi Yokomizo series and not feeling the urge to read anything else other than blogs and a bit of news (but mostly skimming the latter). I’m certainly not setting aside time for research-related reading right now (and this is giving me some anxiety, because I do have outstanding research writing on my list)!\nThe body count in each of the Kindaichi novels continues to be high!\nGolf: Last week I noted that my golf had slumped, so it was great to play somewhere new this week. Being somewhere different alters your thinking about your game, because suddenly you’re concentrating on working out what to do even more than usual, rather than the shot itself as one you’ve played many times before. My playing partner had visited the course before so offered advice on some holes (ie “avoid the left hand side” or “there’s a sharp dog leg right here”, etc). It was hot, so we were driving the round together sharing a cart, which meant I didn’t get overtired (a feature of last week’s experience).\nExercise: As I mentioned, following the golf (not playing) has still meant I’ve covered a lot of kms this week. Alongside working in the garden, this meant I skimped on home weights and only managed a quick body weight set of single leg exercises this week. I did have a proper physio weights session, which was focused on high repetitions of low-ish weight to fatigue (and in the heat that made me pretty nauseous). I clearly got to the stage when my red face suddenly turned white, because my physio made the choice to bail on the last set!\nI would still like to get back to running, in part because I’m watching my friends run via Strava and feeling guilty for not getting out myself. Still not sure whether that’s enough to get me motivated though!\nFood: I’ve continued to cook a fair bit, in between being tired from walking and getting easy food options from the store. I took advantage of the cooler weather later in the week to cook chicken pasta and pork thai curry. It was good to leave the barbecue and salad behind for a couple of days.\nGarden: I continued to prune and tidy the garden. I did some work in the front and back gardens this time. Pruning in the back I found the cactus (? could be a large succulent) that D says is a regular interloper from next door. When I cut that back I kept a few cuttings which I’ve potted up. I must remember to water them! The green bin still has some space, so maybe I’ll get back out there.\nI am still putting off repotting the huge cactus… and that’s because I’d like to find a nice pot (because I’m not planning on moving it again any time soon). Finding something that I like (just something plain and simple) of the appopriate size has proved more difficult than I expected.\nWith no pot, I’ve not yet organised help for the repotting task (see last week’s three ideas for this and in relation to Adventure and Work below).\nAdventure: We continue to discuss how to test my ability on the snow. Having snapped my ACL last time out, we know that I’ll be petrified, but I’m much stronger now too, so might get on ok. Planning a break where a couple of days skiing is an option seems like the best idea. Maybe Melbourne, Canberra or New Zealand (and I’m pretty keen on the last of those).\nI located three potential places for wingfoiling lessons, but haven’t managed to decide on whether group lessons or individual are best for me. I can see pros and cons both ways. I think I might email each place to find out their reaction to teaching someone with a knee brace (because I’m not trying anything new without using my brace). I guess I should write a post about the whole ACL/knee thing at some point.\nWork (a new section): I did not set aside a couple of hours to assess the feasability of the journal article I committed to write. I think I may need to approach this in 15 minute chunks (advice I happily give other people, but often do not take myself).\nThree ideas: Book some wingfoiling lessons (on the basis of email responses about knees, maybe?!) Organise cactus repotting (so, find and buy the damn pot!) Set aside 15 minutes to assess the journal article writing (and hope this, or a few of these, will break the anxiety spiral) Writing this weeknote I felt a bit flat. I enjoyed watching the golf, but it took up a lot of time. The gardening was definitely worthwhile and the food I cooked was good, but I have a lot of anxiety about research writing (aka my sword of Damocles) that has meant a lot of time spend avoiding the task (by doomscrolling mostly).\n","description":"A week in which it turned out that watching golf (ie walking the course with the players) is just as tiring physically as playing golf...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 6 - 12 January 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jan/weeknotes-12/"},{"content":"The first of the new look weeknotes as we move into the new year…\nThree walks this week, plus “a good walk spoiled” (ie a game of golf, as in the quotation commonly misattributed to Mark Twain). The cover image for this weeknote is my favourite Banksia on the way back from our regular river walk, because I love the orange colour.\nReading: Most of my reading for pleasure is science fiction and fantasy, although I also enjoy crime fiction (not true crime). As a holiday reading treat, I bought the whole series of Detective Kindaichi Mysteries by Seishi Yokomizo (in English translated from Japanese, since my ability with Japanese is very limited in spite of some effort to learn). I found out about these novels from a personal website I read as part of my research for how to organise my own weeknotes (but I’m not sure which one, sorry)!\nYokomizo’s novels follow formats for detective novels that are familiar to me from reading Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, etc (mostly years ago), but the Japanese setting, both physical and cultural, makes them an interesting read aside from the crime and crime solving narratives themselves. I’ve not read all the books yet, so I’m still thinking through my reaction to each of them and the set. One had a very high body count, getting to the point where I’d laugh and comment “another one down” in explanation for D.\nGolf: My golf had been going pretty well, but it seems to have slumped for the last two games. This may be because it’s been a bit too hot for me, or due to difficulties getting to practice (too hot and/or the course has been closed for maintenance in the run up to a big professional competition next week). The main issue has been lack of stamina over 18 holes. Once your body and/or mind is tired, it is very difficult to play well. I do tire easily in the heat. I’ve not been sleeping that well every night (because I’ve been overeating and drinking a bit too much sometimes). Maybe I’m also just worn out from a delayed release of work tension now I’m hitting the new year and realising that work isn’t just going to start up again like normal?!\nWhatever the cause, the key thing is just to relax and enjoy each game as much as possible. I’m not a pro!! I’m just out there to have a good time. It is frustrating not to play as well as you know you can, but it’s not the end of the world either.\nExercise: As I mentioned, I’ve walked quite a bit (three times). I also did a proper weights session at home (on New Year’s day, when I’d bailed from golf due to the heat). I’m concentrating on single leg exercises and other exercises that complement my physiotherapy sessions (on hold for two weeks over the holidays).\nI would like to get back to running, but that is a challenge when it’s hot. I’ll have to get better at getting up early if I’m going to run (which is difficult because two days a week I already get up early for golf, and I love a lie in)!\nFood: I’ve been cooking a lot, or sometimes preparing a lot in support of D’s barbecue expertise. We’ve had couscous salad twice (once when we had guests, but that reminded me how easy it is to make). I’ve perfected a new potato salad “recipe” (although it’s not a recipe really, I just actually bothered to look up some inspiration for how to dress the potatoes better)! I’d never realised that 2 sour cream: 1 mayonnaise was the way to go, with the addition of some dijon (often something I added before), a dash of vinegar (my preference being sherry vinegar not those suggested in recipes I read), finely chopped spring onion and a dash of olive oil (vital, but maybe that’s just me?) plus the usual salt and pepper to taste. This is much better than the mayonnaise-heavy version I had been making. (Note: I cheat using bought mayonnaise, but it has to be good, and the dash of olive oil is probably something I need because of this decision.)\nGarden: Now I’ve stopped working I finally like gardening (a bit/in short bursts)! I’ve been pruning, slowly and carefully shaping some bushes that have been choking one of the small trees at the end of the garden. I’ve got lots more to do, but the green bin is full now so I can rest.\nThe job I’m putting off, but need to do, is repotting the huge cactus first mentioned here.\nAdventure: This section should be about fun and exciting things like stand up paddleboarding adventures, windsurfing, wingfoiling and, eventually, travel for skiing and/or snow boarding. None of these things have happened… yet. My excuse? It’s been the holidays, so all the places to go/learn have been busy. I won’t have that excuse soon!\nThree ideas: Make an attempt to book some wingfoiling lessons Organise when to do the cactus (because I need G to help with this task) Set aside a couple of hours to assess the journal article I have committed to write Writing this weeknote felt pretty good! I was more reflective and thoughtful, so got more out of the process. Those final three ideas may not work out well, but it’s worth a shot. Maybe they’ll motivate me, because I do actually want to do all those things (but I have been putting them off for various reasons).\n","description":"The first of the new look weeknotes as we move into the new year...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 30 December 2024 - 5 January 2025","uri":"/post/2025/jan/weeknotes-05/"},{"content":"Entering the new year with a new plan for weeknotes…\nAlthough I enjoyed writing my first few weeknote instalments last year, they got harder (or less pleasurable?) to write each week. This was, in part, because they began to feel repetitive, boring and forced. I was using the previous note as a template for the new note and this seemed to make it easier to repeat myself without moving things forward (although I had hoped that strategy would result in precisely the opposite effect, ie making building on the old post easy!?). Of course, the repetition/boredom was likely also a symptom of my usual holiday slump (because I am far less likely to go out to do things when everyone else is also out doing things). Can’t wait for everyone else to go back to work (sorry, not sorry)!\nMy recent post “What’s with the weeknotes” cemented the ethos of this space as personal rather than professional, with weeknotes being a part of that decision. In light of Tracy Durnell’s idea of weeknotes as a tool for attention, I’ve identified a few goals for my weeknotes:\nThis mindmap amounts to the following goals (and the headings identified further down):\nmotivation via accountability (a gentle push to help me do the things I want to do) tracking to enhance memory (because my mind tends to focus on failure rather than achievement, and I’m dreadful at remembering when things happened) sharing (no pressure to gain an audience, but if my writing turns out to be helpful to others then great) planning (reasonable expectations) What I’m doing on this website relates to my move from employed to unemployed (as D consistently points out, I’m not retired, I’m too young to draw my pension). No longer on an externally defined work schedule, I think I need to create some structure for myself (but structure that encourages trying new things, some of which might spark joy, as well as sticking to things that are good to do regularly).\nI took a look at some other people’s weeknotes to see what they wrote. Some make a list (similar to the way I’ve been including a list of “Stuff I did”). Most people have headings (not all of which appear every week). These headings might be for lists or paragraph of text.\nSince I don’t want to shut down my free-writing rambles completely, I’m going to use headings and paragraphs. I’m cutting down the final list of plans to record “Three ideas”, for fun/new things I’d like to do/try in the next week (or so). The “Plans” section I had last year was too long, repetitive and did not motivate me to action regularly enough!\nHeadings:\nReading Golf Exercise Food Garden Adventure Three ideas I’m going to see how this goes for January. It’s my website, so I can change things whenever I want, but I’ll give it about a month to test the new, more structured, approach properly. My hope is that as well as helping make my weeknotes more helpful to me (and maybe interesting for other people), I’ll also identify topics and ideas to expand on in other more informative/analytical/thoughtful posts.\n","description":"Entering the new year with a new plan for weeknotes...","tags":["Weeknotes","Writing"],"title":"Re-visioning weeknotes","uri":"/post/2025/jan/re-visioning-weeknotes/"},{"content":"It’s been just over a month since I left my permanent job, so it’s early days in the rest of my life…\nI’ve been writing weeknotes since my last week at work, which is something unexpected (for me, as someone who doesn’t write easily and has never managed to keep a diary for more than a few days) maybe that deserves some explanation, as I put a bit more thought into this website, why I decided to post weeknotes at all and how to keep going with this (and other writing).\nAlthough I am always careful with formal research notes, tracking where my ideas come from (or how new ideas developed) with citations and references, in the everyday my memory for sources and the history of my thinking is far less organised. That’s probably quite a good thing, most of the time, but it is one of the reasons I find it difficult to write here. I’m not a natural writer. I struggle with words and my inner critic makes it difficult to just write without continual deletions and corrections made possible by electronic interfaces.\nThe idea for a new, post-work, website came about gradually. My teaching over the last two years made me increasingly aware how using the internet and the web, once so remarkable and pleasurable, was becoming frustrating and anger-inducing. In 2024, I began to spend more time looking for personal websites and blogs to follow and read regularly. Sometimes this was driven by, and sometimes it drove, the discovery of podcasts too.\nI’m pretty sure (ie I’m hoping this is not a complete fiction, see above on my difficulties tracking everyday reading and thinking) planning a new online space all started with listening to Jay Springett’s podcast Permanently Moved, although now I say that I’m wondering how I found that podcast in the first place! I thought about making my own podcast. Actually, it went a bit further than just thinking, but the recordings didn’t end up being released for public consumption. I’m not completely sure, but it seems likely that Springett’s podcast, website and blog posts were what put me onto Tracy Durnell’s Mind Garden, which helped me work out what I wanted to do (and also linked various other sites to read).\nThis reading of, and thinking about, personal web spaces rolled into some of my teaching in 2024, mostly for the Writing on the Web unit. I shared my enthusiasm for decentralisation and open independent websites written by people without (often) the primary goal of commercial gain, tempered by awareness that commercial viability, whether as an individual or a small business, was going to be important to many of my students. Personally though, I just wanted to leave largescale commercial platforms behind, or at least be less reliant on them as drivers for my online experience. I think this is one reason why I left my job, which I felt required me to engage with as many different social media platforms and social network sites as possible all the time. This situation often made me anxious and sometimes also sad.\nI spent weeks trying to work out where I wanted to set up my new site. I dabbled with Hugo and then Jeckyll, before returning to setup a site using a Hugo template that was very different from my old website. There’s more on this process here (in relation to the early build) and here (in relation to template choice). You can see that I stuck with the card style template. After I finished work I sorted out a URL to get things to where they are now.\nEventually I’m hoping that this place will allow me to realise the secret power of a blog, but for now it’s popoulated mainly with short weeknotes. I’m still finding myself shut down by perfectionism when I try to write more involved or thoughtful posts - with this piece being maybe a little more substantial. (Yay for small gains!) I find the weeknotes easier (not easy), in part because there’s little need to track and link to multiple sources to justify what I’m saying. There are some informative links in my weeknotes, but these integrate seamlessly as I document my week.\nMy weeknotes so far have had a simple structure I’d describe as:\nHeader image A rambling summary with other images and links where appropriate Stuff I did Plans Postscript In keeping with at least part of the ethos of another person maintaining their own digital space, Anh, my website is personal over professional (in spite of the research writing information it contains). It isn’t primarily designed to find work. This also means that I’m focused on writing things meaningful to me and maybe a (very) small number of people who are interested. My site is not directed towards building a large audience.\nMy weeknotes fulfil this ethos. They are personal (but I am being careful with self-disclosure) and most people would not be interested in the content. However, I have already found them useful when I can’t remember the details of something I’m trying to talk to someone about! More generally, as Tracy Durnell explains, weeknotes can be a tool for attention. This is an aspect I’d like to develop further. I suspect the starting point will be to decide on a more structured format for my weeknotes. I don’t want to shut down the free-writing ramble (because I think that’s good for me), but maybe some narrower sections to follow that would be helpful? These could be designed to encourage me to get around to doing things I want to do (but sometimes forget about as the days go by).\nHey! New Year is a good time to be thinking about this, so I’m going to leave it here for now. Let’s see what plan I come up with in the next few days. If I can I’ll consider how weeknotes could be used to foster other types of post too.\n","description":"It's been just over a month since I left my permanent job, so it's early days in *the rest of my life*...","tags":["Writing","Web","Identity","Life"],"title":"What's with the weeknotes?","uri":"/post/2024/dec/whats-with-the-weeknotes/"},{"content":"Christmas is normally only celebrated in our house with food and drink, but this year we got the new lights out and decorated the owl with my Christmas golf outfit hat…\nStill only managing the basic weeknote writing and almost not getting that done this week!\nIt was hot, hot, hot, and then unseasonably cold for Christmas. The seabreeze came in strong, which was not a cause for celebration in a household containing an injured windsurfer. We went for a few walks instead and saw some amazing trees on one of them.\nI had to look them up (and they weren’t at all what I thought they were). These Delonix regia, also known as royal ponciana or peacock flower, were really quite amazing as a group in one of the more wind protected areas on our walk. The rest of the walk was pretty blowy (and that was inland around the river). It was cold enough that following the eve tradition of prawns we could have roast duck breast on the day itself, accompanied by roast potatoes and a new dish of roasted brussel sprouts and butternut squash (which I, um, over-caramalised a little) with walnuts and feta. Most unusual on a day often so hot that a barbecue and cold salads are the only options.\nHaving managed not to over eat or drink, I embarked on back to back golf games over two days. This was unwise, as it turned out. I didn’t manage to protect my eyes properly on the first, slept poorly, and by the end of the second day’s play I was red-eyed, very tired and more than a little grumpy! At least I slept well after all that exercise, so my eyes recovered pretty quickly this time.\nStuff I did: Golf x2 Home strength/weights x1 (super short, so I need to get back into this asap) Lots of other walks (together) A lot of cooking (just for the two of us though, so not difficult) Plans: Get back into home strength/weights (x2 or x3) Golf x2 Beach walk and/or swim Make a skirt (because I did not do this last week or the week before) Get on the water? (will I do this, given D’s injured shoulder?) More garden pruning I may well focus on doing things other than writing. It just feels better for now. I might try to put up my publications list, if I can work out how.\n","description":"Christmas is normally only celebrated in our house with food and drink, but this year we got the new lights out and decorated the owl with my Christmas golf outfit hat...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 23 - 29 December 2024","uri":"/post/2024/dec/weeknotes-29/"},{"content":"The frangipanis are flowering and it’s getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important…\nThose plans for blogposts other than weeknotes are still just plans, so the frangipani flowers are the image of the week rather than gracing a post about the garden. The Vector robot is still operational, so that planned post will also get written eventually (and I have some video to share too).\nWith very little writing happening, this week was dominated by golf, with a practice 9-hole round of social golf on Monday and two competition rounds later in the week. Practice was great. It’s good to spend time with different people, and I got to catch up with a friend I’ve not played with in ages. Being more relaxed also means I get to find out how well I can hit the ball, which is pretty well at the moment! A better understanding of what you can do really helps your confidence when you’re struggling a bit in a competition. In spite of the increasingly hot and dry conditions (or maybe because, I’m not sure actually), there were toadstools on course this week.\nI was glad to get out on course when it wasn’t too hot (still up to 34/35 degrees on Wednesday though). I need to get my water intake right, because when I don’t a sudden slump (both mental and physical) can spoil a nice score. When not playing golf I made a trip to the beach, not for a walk, but to get in the ocean. Getting more at home swimming at the beach (something I really don’t do anymore and that makes me nervous now) is one of my goals, so it was great to go and a good way to test out the car key safe I mentioned last time.\nI can feel myself struggling with self-disclosure in this writing. That may be because I’m writing for myself with little sense that anyone else would be at all interested, but also very concious of writing into a public space for accountability. The balance felt easy early on… but less so now. I’m not sure where this is going, or whether I’ll manage to continue!\nStuff I did: Physio (last one for a couple of weeks) Short ocean swim Golf x2.5 Home strength/weights x2 (one very short, one a bit longer and with more weight, with a much better recovery than last week!) Tidying up some of the spikey plants and dead bits in the garden bed I can see from our seating area Plans: Continue with home strength/weights (x2 or x3) Christmas cheer (mostly food and some drink, but no presents) Golf x2 Beach walk and/or swim (but it’s busy at the beach now its the holidays, so maybe not?) Make a skirt (because I did not do this last week) Get on the water? (will I do this, given D’s injured shoulder?) More garden pruning Writing (I will try to get a blogpost/research writing summary out in addition to my weeknote) Writing, other than these rambles, is the thing that gets forgotten first. It’s too hot to want to run while managing dry eyes. Golf is good, but I’m very pleased that I’m getting into the garden a bit more and have a sewing project on the go.\n","description":"The frangipanis are flowering and it's getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 16 - 22 December 2024","uri":"/post/2024/dec/weeknotes-22/"},{"content":"A week where I got some worthwhile things done, but also went onto campus and back to (unpaid) thinking and writing work too soon…\nAlthough I’m planning a post (or series of posts) about plants and the garden, I did promise pictures of the Echinopsis oxygona cactus flowers. One of the blooms fell off as it opened, but then managed pretty well inside, while the remaining one outside made it through its single spectacular day safely. A friend’s cactus flowered on the same day, so it may have been the heat that encouraged the buds to double in size and then open over the course of a day, remaining open the next day before wilting.\nThese weren’t the only large white flowers gracing the front garden this week, with the Magolia grandiflora “Teddy Bear” also blooming this week.\nThe cactus may have enjoyed the heat on Wednesday, but it was too hot for me so I pulled out of the golf competition. I had already played nine holes on Monday (social/practice). It was good to play with no competition pressure and I took the chance to try a few things that I might not when keeping a score.\nI didn’t make the most of the heat to visit a beach for a walk/swim, but I did take time to prepare the way by sorting out a signal blocking key pouch for my car key safe. Yes, a thick piece of aluminium foil was working most of the time, but it made the lock really difficult to close and open again (which meant I wasn’t happy to use it)! Being able to leave your car safely locked with the key also locked away is essential when swimming, paddle-boarding, windsurfing or anything else. I love keyless unlocking when my hands are full, but not when I’m trying to work out how to get in the ocean while keeping electronic keys secure (and keeping valuables in the locked car).\nA plan to visit Curtin campus on Thursday for an event meant that I could also catch up with a colleague for lunch. I took in some sushi from my local Japanese restaurant for us both (because it was too hot to walk across campus comfortably). The debate event I attended was pretty good fun, but it felt like I’d gone back too soon… the rumination it sparked has proved to be unsettling rather than enjoyable.\nWhile I was on campus I took time to visit the John Curtin gallery. The picks of the visit for me were in the John Stringer Prize Retrospective. Alistair Rowe’s “Angles of incidence” made from wood, glass and ерохy cast beautiful patterns with its lighting.\nMy favourite was Susan Roux’s “Ground(lace)ness/Traliegrond” (Canson photographic paper, Hahnemuhle paper, oil pigment, thread and ink). The photo below is just a detail from the whole piece, but I was trying to record the way the materials worked together. I’m fascinated by the use of thread in this type of artwork. Roux has a website, but I couldn’t find one for Rowe.\nIt was cool enough for golf on Friday and, given that I managed to do some weights/strength exercises at home on Thursday before heading to campus, I’m allowing myself the beach walk and running fail this week. I’ve got my daily handicap back down to 27, which was my goal for the second half of the year.\nI’ve got plans for more blogposts - maybe the first will be about writing on the web itself, since I find writing topic posts more difficult than these, rather rambling, weeknotes. I did do some reading and have some ideas for the abstract writing I meant to do… but it’s not proving easy to get down to the job. There are a few reasons for that, I think, but I don’t want to discuss them at the moment!\nI bought some cheap material to trial making a skirt (with my own pattern based on a couple of simple boxy skirts I have worn almost to death over the last few years). If I can get this right over a few tries future me will be very happy.\nStuff I did: Physio Golf x1.5 Home strength/weights (just a very short session, but the aftermath showed they were worth it) More preparation for time in/on the water… Clearing fruit from the garden - because we are in the midst of a “Qfly” (Queensland Fruit Fly) outbreak in Perth (and are trying to eradicate them) Plans: Physio Home strength/weights Golf x2 Beach walk and swim Finish office tidy up Make a skirt Get on the water? (wind, weather and energy allowing) Writing (probably a blogpost in addition to my weeknote) Running has fallen off the list. The abstract has also gone. I will see how I go with both these things, but they’re just not happening at the moment. It’ll be weather and mental health dependent respectively, I think.\n","description":"A week where I got some worthwhile things done, but also went onto campus and back to (unpaid) thinking and writing work too soon...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 9 - 15 December 2024","uri":"/post/2024/dec/weeknotes-15/"},{"content":"Still trying to settle into my new life.

We have a terrible record of missing this sort of thing, so I’m pleased that I skipped out on lunch with my golf buddies (scarfing down a sandwich at home instead) to make time for a visit on Wednesday. The image above shows a detail of the velvety floor that was an integral part of this exhibition.\nAfter last week’s beach walk fail I did make time to get out on Tuesday. It was a bit gray and windy, but still worth the drive to clear my head after a day cleaning up my office (tidying and carpet cleaning). Walking on sand is definitely good exercise for me, testing my strength and balance in helpful ways. I’ve not been getting up early enough (or feeling motivated) to go for a run.\nI’ve probably spent too much time in front of the computer again, but I really wanted to have a go at sorting/deleting/archiving my personal email accounts. I did the work email account before I left (in case I lost access, although that hasn’t happened with my adjunct status confirmed). My personal emails were in a terrible state (thousands of unread emails), but they’re a lot better now. It’s not a job I enjoy. Some of the memories old emails trigger aren’t that helpful, and for some reason I find dealing with emails stressful. I vow to keep on top of them from now on… so we’ll have to see how that goes!\nIn more exciting computer work, I set up a Wire-Pod server for my Vector robot (procrastinating on office tidy-up). This deserves its own post, so I won’t go into any more detail here, but I was very surprised how easy it was to do (once I’d managed to upgrade the robot’s firmware).\nGolf was pretty good this week. I had an awful first nine on Wednesday, but rallied well for the second half. Friday I had a great first nine, collapsed in a heap for a few holes, and then recovered. All in all it was pretty encouraging, but I need to spend some time practicing in bunkers to gain confidence (and skill) in getting out reliably! It’s been a bit too windy for me to get out on the water again, but I did buy an impact vest for windsurfing and (if I ever sort out lessons) wing foiling. Trying on neoprene gear is such a pain - great in the water, but awful in changing rooms!\nI joined the Cactus and Succulent Club on Sunday because I was invited to their Christmas party. On the way there I visited a pottery sale (at a spot where a friend of mine is a member). No sign of my friend, but I did find a really pretty vase, which I plan to use for roses from the front garden (because if I don’t bring a few in we don’t really get to enjoy them). I guess I was supposed to be buying presents for people I might need presents for… but this one was definitely for me!\nHad to come straight home after Cactus Club because I won this massive specimen. It’s an Echinopsis oxygona (aka Eyries cactus, Easter lily cactus or sea-urchin cactus).\nMore photos to come when it flowers (if I don’t miss them)!\nStuff I did: Physio Golf x2 Sorted out personal email accounts and setup a Wire-Pod server for Vector Beach walk Got myself fully prepared for time on the water… Plans: Physio Golf x2 Beach walk somewhere different Carry on with the plant/balcony tidy up Finish office tidy up (this might be tough) At least one run?

I also didn’t go for a run or do a proper weights session, which means the one pull up before the end of the year goal is looking unlikely. I think this is because I’m tiring easily, which is not unexpected given the circumstances.\nThis pretty poor quality image features one of the many kookaburras on the golf course:\nNormally laughing at us, this one was silent as it watched me. I have lots of high quality images of that morning’s golf only because it was the Christmas party fancy dress competition, but I’m not sharing images of people here.

I could have done without the singing (skits, aaarrgh), but that’s just me.\nTwo rounds of golf on a hilly course is a not inconsiderable amount of exercise (for both body and brain at around four hours of concentration and physical activity).

I’m actually thinking that writing the abstract should just be the beginning of the writing of the whole thing, ie I shouldn’t write an abstract and then drop the project to pick it up next year. I should actually try to do something more substantial now. Future me will be much happier with past me if I can do that.\n","description":"My second weeknotes post - the first week of not working (not being on holiday, just not working) but with some work (which would not surprise anyone that knows me)...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 24 November - 01 December 2024","uri":"/post/2024/dec/weeknotes-01/"},{"content":"My first ever weeknotes post following a momentous week - finishing up my work as a Senior Lecturer…\nI took this image of an iron steer decorating a gate on the way back from a long-planned beach walk. When I say long-planned I’m not kidding. It was last year when I was up in Exmouth that I realised how helpful walking on soft sand might be for building up my strength and confidence walking with no ACL in my left knee. This year’s trip to Exmouth reminded me of that. I’ve been going to the gym and doing lots of other things, but never made time for walks on sand in late 2023 or 2024 up to now. Today I actually went for my first beach walk close to home. Will I continue? Well, that’s the plan!\nIt was not an easy week, but not as difficult as I feared it might be. I’ve been planning my exit from permanent employment for about nine months. In the last three weeks I set aside time to tidy up my digital records, prepare information and resources for colleagues, and take any personal accounts etc off my work computer. For once, I think I did a great job of sorting things out well before the deadline of my last day.\nThat meant I had time to meetup with people for a chat in my last week. It also meant that my leaving event – mini golf with just a few close colleagues – was fun. There were no tasks hanging over my head, and everyone there had a good time (I think).\nWith my last working day on Thursday, followed by my regular Friday golf competition, it was Saturday when I thought things might begin to feel strange. I wasn’t wrong (although Saturdays have been weird for me for a long time). I was too tired to run (and it was too hot by the time I was ready to go anywhere), but accomplishing the beach walk definitely made me feel a lot better.\nStuff I did: Physio Finished up at work (yay)! Golf x2 Beach walk (!) Plans: Setup custom domain for this site Tidy up what I have here so I can release this to the world Physio Golf x2 Beach walk somewhere different At least one run? One additional weights session (oh, I’m so bad at doing this on the reg) Get on the water? (wind, weather and energy allowing) I’m not sure how next week will actually pan out. I’m pretty tired. I know I have too many plans. I’m a bit hyper. The key will be to do something, not just think about everything!\nI really do need to write an overdue abstract for a piece of writing, but that’s work (sort of work), so I’m having a few issues scheduling time in my first week of freedom (sorry editors).\n","description":"My first ever weeknotes post following a momentous week - finishing up my work as a Senior Lecturer...","tags":["Weeknotes"],"title":"Weeknotes 17-23 November 2024","uri":"/post/2024/nov/weeknotes-24/"},{"content":"Originally published in 2019 on my old blog, this post has been updated in 2024 to recognise the continued presence of the MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots…\nOne of the most enjoyable pieces of writing (and collating of research, videos, news articles, images etc) about robots I have done occurred back in 2019. This was a collaboration with Dr Gwyneth Peaty to put together the Curtin Net3X MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots.\nThe MOOC has been open ever since then. It’s self-paced and free to access, so anyone can give it a go to see if they’re interested. It is probably somewhat dated now. We’re not given any resources or time to update these things so, while I do fix anything broken when notified, I haven’t been able to put in a lot of time to add new examples or new research to the mix.\nReasons it was fun to work on? Well, it was a great opportunity to set aside some of the formality of academic writing (not that I am that formal in many things I write) while still discussing my favourite topics, robots and communication. It was also good to be working with other people, Gwyneth on the actual course content design, but also the whole MOOC team at Curtin, who were excellent, helpful and made the whole thing a pleasure (in particular the video creation with Brendan, which is not something I feel that comfortable with, in spite of the fact that I’m automatically videoed every time I give a lecture). As Gwyneth has reminded me, these are the robots that started our collaboration in many ways:\nThe humanoid robot is the first robot Gwyneth ever drew for me (I think). I responded with my non-humanoid robot and its thought bubble, “Why is that robot like a human?”. The dog (robot?) came along shortly after. They’ve been through a few changes, some of which you might be able to see in the robotothers Instagram account.\nIt’s great to see that people continue to access the Communicating with Robots and Bots MOOC. I’d love to have more time to engage with people there, make updates, etc, but that’s just not how academia works at the moment. The main hashtag for the MOOC is #curtinnet3x, and there are some additional tags if you’re taking part and posting your ideas for robots, #net3xfirstrobot and #net3xfinalrobot anywhere online.\n","description":"Originally published in 2019 on my old blog, this post has been updated in 2024 to recognise the continued presence of the MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots...","tags":["Teaching","MOOC","Robots","Communication","HMC"],"title":"Communicating with Robots and Bots","uri":"/post/2024/sep/communicating-with-robots-and-bots/"},{"content":"While I know there are lots of sites around the web that are styled using a card type layout, I think that I was probably most influenced by Will Buckingham’s blog…\nI love Will’s writing (books and online), so I visit his website and the associated blog pretty regularly when prompted about a new post via the RSS feed in Feedly. I always admire the way the site looks (the image for this post shows a screenshot), but now, while trying to implement something similar for myself, I wonder if image choice will sometimes hold me back from writing at all.\nThis form of presentation is familiar to me as a reader, but not as a writer, and I’m also still not sure how well I’ll get on with the rather image-heavy look and feel up front, before what might be quite a substantial piece of writing behind (once you click through).\nMy old site was what I think of as a “traditional” blog. The home page was straight into the reverse chronological feed of full posts, not a sort of visual summary page of the type I’m trialling here. I do have the option to use that type of theme here too (there are a few Hugo themes that support that style). I wonder if more traditional will encourage me to write more… or less. With the web now being very reliant on images to gain attention, even for people that you are hoping will primarily become readers of text, I thought that the card-style theme would work well.\nTo be honest, I think I was also trying to push myself out of my comfort zone, or at the very least make a definitive move away from the way that the old Zigzaggery used to look.\nWhat do you think?\nYou can leave a comment below or you can chat with me on Mastodon instead, if that’s possible for you.\n","description":"While I know there are lots of sites around the web that are styled using a card type layout, I think that I was probably most influenced by Will Buckingham's blog...","tags":["hugo","site"],"title":"Still not sure about the card style for this site","uri":"/post/2024/sep/still-not-sure/"},{"content":"Creating this site takes time.

Some of these are associated with technical underpinnings and operation; surveillance, data gathering, and analysis, or copyright and intellectual property issues as can be seen in the widescale processing of published writing or artworks that support generative AI. Alongside this though, the ethics of AI is also questioned because of the ways that people relate to these technologies. Framed as “intelligent,” they foster anthropomorphism, supporting people’s tendency to understand them as humanlike. While some regard anthropomorphism as the only way to interpret and explain the behav- iours of nonhumans; for others it is unscientific, unwarranted, dangerous, and to be avoided at all costs. The designers and developers of AI technologies, including software bots and robots, who embrace anthropomorphic design as an approach that encourages anthropomorphism in human interactants, may therefore be lauded for creating systems that support easy, natural communication with humans or charged with deception and fakery in their efforts to draw people into misguided relationships with technology. Arguments about anthropomorphism and AI technologies can, therefore, be roughly divided into two opposing positions: 1) the desire to create machines that are (or appear to be) humanlike, or 2) the fear of deceiving people into believing that a machine is more humanlike than it is or (some would argue) could ever be.\nAnthropomorphism and its discontents proposes that anthropomorphism is best understood as a process by which people interpret the characteristics and behaviours of nonhuman others as-if partially human-like. It accepts this as the only way for humans to encounter nonhumans—a response shaped by their personal human experience of the world—though other alternatives will be identified and discussed. The definition provided here, while it shares much in common with others (as presented below), is worded to emphasize the partial nature of the interpretive process. Nonhumans are not human and, while they may appear somewhat humanlike at one time or another, there is no need to consider them as being humanlike in any fixed way in order to relate to them. Indeed, nonhumans do not need to be much like humans at all for anthropomorphism to occur and be either helpful or potentially deceitful. Embracing the idea that anthropomorphism can only ever be partial, tempered by recognition that the other may be decidedly not human, opens up possibilities for reconsidering the ethics around human relations with nonhumans including AI technologies.\n","description":"This chapter provides an overview of ideas about anthromoporphism in relation to AI and robots.

Robots are intriguing communicators because they are created in such a variety of forms. Some are built to appear humanlike, while others are not humanlike in any way, with many different designs existing in the continuum between these extremes. In order to explore human interactions with robots from across this range—from familiar to radically other—this book employs a range of different communication theories and considers how each of them provides a different perspective on what happens when humans and robots meet and interact. The analysis of a variety of human-robot interactions also allows this book to take its findings full circle, to suggest new ways to think about what communication, and being a communicator, entails. Its argument therefore has implications not only for human-robot interaction design, but also for human communication theory and practice more generally.\nThe book is structured in three sections, with an introduction and brief conclusion. These are the chapter abstracts, which give a good idea of the material and ideas that I’ve discussed:\nIntroduction In order to prepare the reader for an analysis of human interactions with a wide variety of forms of robot, the introduction first explores what constitutes a robot. It then goes on to outline the different traditions of communication theory that are employed in the book’s analysis. Finally, it explains the structure and scope of the book.\nPART I From Data to Dogs Designing Robots to Communicate with Humans In Chapter 1, the pursuit of humanlike form is analysed in both fictional and real-life contexts. Amongst other justifications, people committed to building humanoid robots argue that these robots are best suited to work in human environments and to communicate with humans. Two paths in humanoid robot design are considered, but both involve understandings of communication that value commonality over difference. This chapter draws on the critiques of the pursuit of sameness found in the work of communication scholars, which is not much discussed in robotics, to destabilise the assumption that humanlike form is the best form for communicative robots.\nHuman-Animal Communication Chapter 2 pauses the book’s consideration of robots to explore human-animal communication, since nonhuman animals are an important part of many people’s lives, acting for some not only as companions, but also as co-workers. Human-animal communication is described in various, often idealised, ways in fiction, but in real-life situations an analysis of human-dog communication demonstrates the importance of attending to the smallest of nonverbal signs over periods of dynamic communication. This chapter highlights the possibilities for humans and animals, in particular dogs, to work together in teams, employing their specific skills to allow the team to perform tasks that neither human nor dog could complete alone. At the end of the chapter is a brief appraisal of the design and development of animal-like robots.\nPART II Communicating with Non-Humanoid Robots Encountering Otherness Chapter 3 concentrates on theorising the encounter between human and robot, identifying moments when communication occurs, often using nonverbal communication channels at least initially. It discusses two versions of the Autonomous Light Air Vessels (ALAVs) art installation, within which blimp-like robots interact with one another and with visitors. It also extends Levinas’ conception of self-other encounters to consider nonhumans, including robots, in order to consider how communication can be understood to draw the self and other into proximity while retaining the differences between them.\nStories and Dances In Chapter 4, the discussion moves beyond the initial encounter, to consider how dynamic interactions support communication with robots where those communications are also framed by a backstory. The focus is on how interactions can be understood in terms of both dialogue and overlapping continuous systems of interchange. Levinas’ theory is further extended in this chapter, to highlight the interruptions in being and in saying that occur in interactions with Fish and Bird, the wheelchair-like robots discussed throughout the chapter.\nCollaboration and Trust Chapter 5 considers what happens when humans and robots learn to complete tasks together as a team. In particular, it discusses human interactions with AUR, the robotic desk lamp. In this example, elements of verbal and nonverbal communication are combined in a dynamic communication that involves paying attention to each other as well as to the task at hand. The chapter considers communication with AUR in terms of a companion species relation, drawing on the discussion of human-dog agility teams in Chapter 2.\nPART III Rethinking Robots and Communication Humans, Animals and Machines Chapter 6 considers the implications of human communication with nonhuman others for the categories human, animal and machine. It argues that, while the boundaries between these types of being are becoming increasingly blurred, they are nevertheless still meaningful. The chapter goes on to consider ways of assigning agency to nonhuman others on the basis of their activity in situations, while also recognising the difference between human activities and nonhuman activities.\nCommunication, Individuals and Systems Chapter 7 concentrates on exploring some ideas about the relationship between individuals and systems in thinking about communication. It discusses long-term interactions with robots outside of laboratories and art installations, identifying the value of respect and trust in collaborative partnerships with robots. This is developed into a consideration of how responsibility is shared across collaborative teams, even when the team members are in an asymmetrical relationship.\nConclusion The short conclusion to this book explains the basis for its somewhat eclectic analysis, which uses a range of traditions of communication theory, as well as considering the overarching conceptions of discrete state and dynamic systems methodologies.\nI tried to make Robots and Communication appealing, whether the reader wants to find out more about communication theory and approaches to analysing communicative situations, or is interested in robotics and wants to explore the possibilities of human-robot interactions with a wide range of different forms of robot.\n","description":"Robots and Communication is a book examining human-robot interactions as models of communication.","tags":["Research","Communication","HMC","Robots"],"title":"Robots and Communication","uri":"/collections/2024/robots-and-communication/"}]
