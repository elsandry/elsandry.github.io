      <description>A round of golf is long&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and can become frustrating, even demoralising. Even when things have been going well it&amp;rsquo;s weirdly difficult to stay positive. Disaster can seem just around the corner.</description>

      <description>I have played a lot of golf since my last golf-dedicated post from July 2025&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;a statement that covers range practice, social and competition rounds, because when I used the word &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; to talk about golf practice recently my coach questioned whether that description was helpful.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few conversations in the last week or so, most recently with my golf coach, which have made me think about goals&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;in relation to golf and life more generally.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s with the weeknotes?</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been just over a month since I left my permanent job, so it&amp;rsquo;s early days in the rest of my life&amp;hellip;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing weeknotes since my last week at work, which is something unexpected (for me, as someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t write easily and has never managed to keep a diary for more than a few days) maybe that deserves some explanation, as I put a bit more thought into this website, why I decided to post weeknotes at all and how to keep going with this (and other writing).</description>
