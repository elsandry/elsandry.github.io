      <description>My range practice has almost becomes more about warmup strategy than anything else&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;because what I&amp;rsquo;m practising is the basics of contact, direction and distance. For a warmup I&amp;rsquo;ll work up the clubs (usually just odd/even irons to save time and balls) to driver.</description>

      <title>Chipping and pitching practice 2026</title>

      <description>My chipping and pitching practice plans are in constant development&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;in part because there are two areas where I might practice that encourage the use of different intentions. Looking at the image above: one is the yellow rectangular chipping zone, the other is the practice green zone within the blue oval.</description>

      <description>These are my putting practice plans&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;for early 2026. (I&amp;rsquo;ve recycled an old image for the post, since the setup is still in use for part of the plan.)&#xA;Putting setup process I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new process for setting up to putt.</description>

      <description>I have played a lot of golf since my last golf-dedicated post from July 2025&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;a statement that covers range practice, social and competition rounds, because when I used the word &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; to talk about golf practice recently my coach questioned whether that description was helpful.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s turned cold. There was frost on the practice range this morning (shown in image above)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but the cold doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me. So long as it&amp;rsquo;s not windy and raining I&amp;rsquo;ve been practising.</description>

      <description>In an effort to stop leaving putts short (or at least reduce the issue)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out a new putting drill designed to improve pace feel and confidence putting across a range of distances.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done something like this before, thinking about setting the club off and then letting it move with its own momentum&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but this way of envisioning that process seems to work really well.</description>

      <title>New grip process</title>

      <guid>https://zigzaggery.space/post/2025/jun/new-grip-process/</guid>
      <description>Practice on the range convinced me I still needed to do more work on grip&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;developing a better process to setup my grip and movement to address the ball. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot already about grip and setup processes, but things have been morphing while I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since a dedicated golf update&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s been some weather getting in the way of practice and play. More broadly, I&amp;rsquo;ve not been feeling great (mentally), which leads to a lack of motivation and energy to practice.</description>

      <description>The driver is a club I can hit really well - one of my first novelty prizes was for longest drive at my grade - but it is also the one that tests my skill and nerve the most&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a bucket full of pain&amp;rdquo;, said the guy walking towards me with his mate as I headed to the driving range this morning&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t say that&amp;rdquo;, I replied, &amp;ldquo;we need to keep some positivity here&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I think Joan Westenberg&amp;rsquo;s argument about backing systems over sparks is a great way to understand golf and how to improve one&amp;rsquo;s game&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;so I&amp;rsquo;ve written this quick post to draw out the words that hit home for me, because Westenberg probably (certainly?</description>

      <description>Just over three weeks since my last golf update (other than mentions in weeknotes)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;safe to say things have been a bit up and down (and back up again).&#xA;The weather has cooled with storms and rain threatening to impact (see image above, taken just before I drove to the Wednesday competition this week), but largely not affecting, my practice and competition play.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to practice diligently, but with varied success&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;Tuesday went badly on the driving range at first, with lots of pulls left. After moving to the other practice area for some chipping in the zone (pictured above), I returned to hit another bucket of range balls a little better.</description>

      <title>Aaargh grip change</title>

      <guid>https://zigzaggery.space/post/2025/mar/aaargh-grip-change/</guid>
      <description>Continued regular practice chipping/pitching meant that, once again, I could move on to something new with my third golf lesson&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, changing my grip is an important part of this journey, but it&amp;rsquo;s so weird that during the back swing it feels like hitting the ball is a physical impossibility, except it then turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not (mostly).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few conversations in the last week or so, most recently with my golf coach, which have made me think about goals&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;in relation to golf and life more generally.</description>

      <description>Regular practice, for 5 days out of 6 after my first, meant my second golf lesson was about the follow through, along with tips for practice and analysis of progress&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>So it begins&amp;hellip; the deconstruction of my golf swing&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;shortly followed by, I hope, its reconstruction in a new and better form!&#xA;The cover image for this post shows seven stages in the golf swing, modelled by a skeleton (which will be male, I think we can safely assume) taken from a 2022 review paper about golf swing biomechanics.</description>
