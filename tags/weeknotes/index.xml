      <description>A long weekend here that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel that way, with lots of golf, some music and pretty skies&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;that are pictured above and below. Still getting incandescently irritated with myself when I do something wrong, forget something and/or do nothing (ie procrastinate a day away).</description>

      <description>Good things, but personal frustration too&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;as I managed to do some of the things, but not all of the things (and didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to let go of irritation with myself as the week moved by).</description>

      <description>Art, art and there should have been more art (but the opening times didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me), lunch, beach and golf&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;so I did well this week, but am annoyed I missed David Spencer&amp;rsquo;s Pentimento in Fremantle.</description>

      <description>Not a fantastic week, with the car breaking down (and me with it, to some extent)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but I&amp;rsquo;m feeling much better and the car is fixed, so things are looking up again.</description>

      <description>Hot and humid days have meant I was lacking in energy, but I did flop about in the ocean with a windsurfer two more times. I met this shield bug in the park where I recovered the second time&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Back down to the windsurfing beach this week and I had a go this time&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but it didn&amp;rsquo;t go great!&#xA;On a positive note, all my new kit fitted well, I was very comfortable and my leg brace felt fine (so fine that really I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice it at all unless I was kneeling on the board trying to uphaul).</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t get too excited. I don&amp;rsquo;t kitesurf (since a scary experience just after I finished lessons) and I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet managed to get back on the windsurfer. I did make it to the beach&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For some reason this was a week dominated by irritability&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and I&amp;rsquo;m not absolutely sure why. It might have something to do with wanting to feel I&amp;rsquo;m improving my golf game (but still only managing to play well for half any given round).</description>

      <description>A week in which it turned out that watching golf (ie walking the course with the players) is just as tiring physically as playing golf&amp;hellip;&#xA;This week there was a professional competition at my club, so I got the chance to play another great local course for free (because we get offered alternative tee times elsewhere when we can&amp;rsquo;t access our own course).</description>

      <description>The first of the new look weeknotes as we move into the new year&amp;hellip;&#xA;Three walks this week, plus &amp;ldquo;a good walk spoiled&amp;rdquo; (ie a game of golf, as in the quotation commonly misattributed to Mark Twain).</description>

      <description>Entering the new year with a new plan for weeknotes&amp;hellip;&#xA;Although I enjoyed writing my first few weeknote instalments last year, they got harder (or less pleasurable?) to write each week.</description>

      <description>Christmas is normally only celebrated in our house with food and drink, but this year we got the new lights out and decorated the owl with my Christmas golf outfit hat&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The frangipanis are flowering and it&amp;rsquo;s getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important&amp;hellip;&#xA;Those plans for blogposts other than weeknotes are still just plans, so the frangipani flowers are the image of the week rather than gracing a post about the garden.</description>

      <description>A week where I got some worthwhile things done, but also went onto campus and back to (unpaid) thinking and writing work too soon&amp;hellip;&#xA;Although I&amp;rsquo;m planning a post (or series of posts) about plants and the garden, I did promise pictures of the Echinopsis oxygona cactus flowers.</description>

      <description>Still trying to settle into my new life. I did manage to get a few things done while also trying to chill out (and avoid feeling like I have to do all the things all at once)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>My first ever weeknotes post following a momentous week - finishing up my work as a Senior Lecturer&amp;hellip;&#xA;I took this image of an iron steer decorating a gate on the way back from a long-planned beach walk.</description>
