      <description>Just another week, with a lot of considering, not that much doing, but some good talking time&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;with D and G.&#xA;Reading: Still re-reading The Traveler&amp;rsquo;s Gate Trilogy by Will Wight, which I am enjoying a lot.</description>

      <description>Filling in medical forms drains my energy as does playing trash golf, but my attempts to do things (whatever they might be) continue&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;while I&amp;rsquo;ve not implemented the block method from How to Do Things I have identified a few things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do in the next few months.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing with my time, other than trying to improve my golf, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I could be getting a little more done now I&amp;rsquo;ve been off work for a while&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>A better week than last week, with a lot of smoke towards the end, but also lower temperatures&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;which meant I did get a few more things done this week (as well as playing quite a bit of golf at the course, pictured in the evening light for this week&amp;rsquo;s cover image).</description>

      <description>I admit it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to write these weeknotes&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but keeping them going still seems useful. This week has been hot, with easterly winds of the type that have the potential to dry my eyes out so they burn.</description>

      <description>Took no proper photos this week, so here&amp;rsquo;s a really bad one of the river and ocean view through the gap between houses&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;for a week where I caught up with people I&amp;rsquo;d not seen for months and years respectively, while not looking forward to the return of summer temperatures in a few days time.</description>

      <description>This crow has probably seen a lot of me this week (image of the weeknote)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;as it flew around the golf course.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m so tired that as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this I really can&amp;rsquo;t think what to say (see Golf below).</description>

      <description>A long weekend here that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel that way, with lots of golf, some music and pretty skies&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;that are pictured above and below. Still getting incandescently irritated with myself when I do something wrong, forget something and/or do nothing (ie procrastinate a day away).</description>

      <description>Good things, but personal frustration too&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;as I managed to do some of the things, but not all of the things (and didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to let go of irritation with myself as the week moved by).</description>

      <description>Art, art and there should have been more art (but the opening times didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me), lunch, beach and golf&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;so I did well this week, but am annoyed I missed David Spencer&amp;rsquo;s Pentimento in Fremantle.</description>

      <description>Not a fantastic week, with the car breaking down (and me with it, to some extent)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but I&amp;rsquo;m feeling much better and the car is fixed, so things are looking up again.</description>

      <description>Hot and humid days have meant I was lacking in energy, but I did flop about in the ocean with a windsurfer two more times. I met this shield bug in the park where I recovered the second time&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Back down to the windsurfing beach this week and I had a go this time&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but it didn&amp;rsquo;t go great!&#xA;On a positive note, all my new kit fitted well, I was very comfortable and my leg brace felt fine (so fine that really I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice it at all unless I was kneeling on the board trying to uphaul).</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t get too excited. I don&amp;rsquo;t kitesurf (since a scary experience just after I finished lessons) and I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet managed to get back on the windsurfer. I did make it to the beach&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For some reason this was a week dominated by irritability&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and I&amp;rsquo;m not absolutely sure why. It might have something to do with wanting to feel I&amp;rsquo;m improving my golf game (but still only managing to play well for half any given round).</description>

      <description>A week in which it turned out that watching golf (ie walking the course with the players) is just as tiring physically as playing golf&amp;hellip;&#xA;This week there was a professional competition at my club, so I got the chance to play another great local course for free (because we get offered alternative tee times elsewhere when we can&amp;rsquo;t access our own course).</description>

      <description>The first of the new look weeknotes as we move into the new year&amp;hellip;&#xA;Three walks this week, plus &amp;ldquo;a good walk spoiled&amp;rdquo; (ie a game of golf, as in the quotation commonly misattributed to Mark Twain).</description>

      <description>Entering the new year with a new plan for weeknotes&amp;hellip;&#xA;Although I enjoyed writing my first few weeknote instalments last year, they got harder (or less pleasurable?) to write each week.</description>

      <description>The frangipanis are flowering and it&amp;rsquo;s getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important&amp;hellip;&#xA;Those plans for blogposts other than weeknotes are still just plans, so the frangipani flowers are the image of the week rather than gracing a post about the garden.</description>

      <description>A week where I got some worthwhile things done, but also went onto campus and back to (unpaid) thinking and writing work too soon&amp;hellip;&#xA;Although I&amp;rsquo;m planning a post (or series of posts) about plants and the garden, I did promise pictures of the Echinopsis oxygona cactus flowers.</description>
