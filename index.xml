      <description>Still trying to settle into my new life. I did manage to get a few things done while also trying to chill out (and avoid feeling like I have to do all the things all at once)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Still not sure about the card style for this site</title>

      <description>While I know there are lots of sites around the web that are styled using a card type layout, I think that I was probably most influenced by Will Buckingham&amp;rsquo;s blog&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Creating a new website...</title>

      <description>Creating this site takes time. I&amp;rsquo;m being impatient and really I need to slow down to enjoy the process (and make fewer little mistakes that mean re-doing things time and time again)!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m creating this site using a theme that I am customising in small ways as I go. While I&amp;rsquo;m building I&amp;rsquo;m just using GitHub Pages as a server for the site.</description>

      <title>Which commercial social network to leave first?</title>
      <link>https://zigzaggery.space/notes/2020/change2/</link>

      <description>One of the reasons I find it difficult to teach Digital and Social Media is that I&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; pretty much hate all the commercial social networks now. The first I&amp;rsquo;ll backburner properly will probably be Facebook.</description>

      <description>Introduction AI technologies raise many ethical questions. Some of these are associated with technical underpinnings and operation; surveillance, data gathering, and analysis, or copyright and intellectual property issues as can be seen in the widescale processing of published writing or artworks that support generative AI.</description>

      <title>Robots and Communication</title>
      <link>https://zigzaggery.space/collections/2024/robots-and-communication/</link>

      <description>Overview Robots and Communication examines human-robot interactions as models of communication. Robots are intriguing communicators because they are created in such a variety of forms.
