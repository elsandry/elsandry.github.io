      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been just over a month since I left my permanent job, so it&amp;rsquo;s early days in the rest of my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing weeknotes since my last week at work, which is something unexpected (for me, as someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t write easily and has never managed to keep a diary for more than a few days)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The frangipanis are flowering and it&amp;rsquo;s getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important&amp;hellip;&#xA;Those plans for blogposts other than weeknotes are still just plans, so the frangipani flowers are the image of the week rather than gracing a post about the garden.</description>

      <description>A week where I got some worthwhile things done, but also went onto campus and back to (unpaid) thinking and writing work too soon&amp;hellip;&#xA;Although I&amp;rsquo;m planning a post (or series of posts) about plants and the garden, I did promise pictures of the Echinopsis oxygona cactus flowers.</description>

      <description>Still trying to settle into my new life. I did manage to get a few things done while also trying to chill out (and avoid feeling like I have to do all the things all at once)&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Originally published in 2019 on my old blog, this post has been updated in 2024 to recognise the continued presence of the MOOC Communicating with Robots and Bots&amp;hellip;&#xA;One of the most enjoyable pieces of writing (and collating of research, videos, news articles, images etc) about robots I have done occurred back in 2019.</description>

      <title>Still not sure about the card style for this site</title>

      <description>While I know there are lots of sites around the web that are styled using a card type layout, I think that I was probably most influenced by Will Buckingham&amp;rsquo;s blog&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Creating a new website...</title>

      <description>Creating this site takes time. I&amp;rsquo;m being impatient and really I need to slow down to enjoy the process (and make fewer little mistakes that mean re-doing things time and time again)!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m creating this site using a theme that I am customising in small ways as I go. While I&amp;rsquo;m building I&amp;rsquo;m just using GitHub Pages as a server for the site.</description>

      <title>Which commercial social network to leave first?</title>
      <link>https://zigzaggery.space/notes/2020/change2/</link>

      <description>One of the reasons I find it difficult to teach Digital and Social Media is that I&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; pretty much hate all the commercial social networks now. The first I&amp;rsquo;ll backburner properly will probably be Facebook.</description>

      <description>Introduction AI technologies raise many ethical questions. Some of these are associated with technical underpinnings and operation; surveillance, data gathering, and analysis, or copyright and intellectual property issues as can be seen in the widescale processing of published writing or artworks that support generative AI.</description>

      <title>Robots and Communication</title>
      <link>https://zigzaggery.space/collections/2024/robots-and-communication/</link>

      <description>Overview Robots and Communication examines human-robot interactions as models of communication. Robots are intriguing communicators because they are created in such a variety of forms. Some are built to appear humanlike, while others are not humanlike in any way, with many different designs existing in the continuum between these extremes.</description>
