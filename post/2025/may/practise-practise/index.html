        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bucket full of pain&rdquo;, said the guy walking towards me with his mate as I headed to the driving range this morning&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that&rdquo;, I replied, &ldquo;we need to keep some positivity here&rdquo;. We laughed, but it turned out to be just that&hellip; positive not painful.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="where-i-went-and-why">Where I went (and why)</h3>
<p>Today I skipped the range at my home course to head to the public golf course. The range there is a bit more open, with very little chance of hitting balls at anyone playing golf in the vicinity. It&rsquo;s wider, longer and a bit flatter (in that the tees are less raised above the landing zone).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to hit my fairway wood and driver on this range (much less so on my home range). This was a key part of today&rsquo;s practice, because I struggled with those clubs yesterday and I wanted to get some better feels.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-i-did">What I did</h3>
<p>I bought a medium bucket, which is around 70 balls on this range. I began with my pitching wedge and worked up the even numbered irons (8 then 6). Then my 25 degree hybrid as a stepping stone to the fairway wood and finally the driver. To cool down, and dial the irons back in a bit, I stepped back via 7 and 8 iron at the end.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="practice-plan">Practice plan</h3>
<p>It was all about setup and full shots today. I wanted to check my process (which has been developing in the last three practices and two rounds). The changes I&rsquo;ve made to my grip and setup, which have knocked on to changes in my swing (I think, although I haven&rsquo;t been trying to change this overtly) have almost removed the left miss from my play (not entirely, but it&rsquo;s way less likely). Instead, I find I&rsquo;m more often pushing things right and occasionally slicing shots (ie seeing them ballon or skid off to the right having started straight-ish), in particular my drives.</p>
<p>A while back I increased the loft on my driver, which really helped correct the lefts at the time, but I realised last time out that I wasn&rsquo;t seeing the club face, or feeling comfortable at address, anymore. I altered my driver back to its neutral loft (10.5 degrees) yesterday to see what that looked like to me now (with my new grip, etc).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="setup-process">Setup process</h3>
<p>I was in the centre of the range, so was always aligning myself to hit straight down the middle. I wanted to make club face alignment easy today, so I could concentrate on other things. I was on a mat (not always ideal, but much better than the grass at this range).</p>
<p>These are my current setup actions and (* thoughts/reasons):</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand up tall, balanced, club in right hand (* you&rsquo;ve got this)</li>
<li>Place club head behind ball with correct face alignment, right hand on top, index finger down shaft, handle and arm on line with inner right hip and right collarbone (* you have control of the club face)</li>
<li>Take comfortable stance with feet keeping club face and handle alignment the same (* relax in balanced tension)</li>
<li>Slide left hand into neutral grip under right hand, settling the grip by &ldquo;wringing the towel&rdquo;, but take care to keep the club in the fingers, left hand neutral and right hand over the top (* relaxed hands, feel club between fingers and thumb of right hand)</li>
<li>Pop the hips to the left slightly, keeping club face and handle alignment steady (* feel the weight in your feet)</li>
<li>Take the shot</li>
</ul>
<p>The hip pop helps me feel my weight balance and seems to improve my ball-first contact. (It&rsquo;s a very subtle movement, not the lurch it became for me a while ago.) It is part of a trigger for taking the shot, although I find bouncing the club head once or twice is becoming a part of this too (remembering that there will be some occasions on course when I can&rsquo;t do that).</p>
<p>The process is the same for all clubs. The ball position in relation to stance is more forward for the driver, with the hip pop maybe a bit more marked, as I tilt my shoulders allowing me to make a solid hit up on the back of the ball.</p>
<p>At the range (difficult on course where you might be pushed for time), if you stand too long, get too still, or don&rsquo;t feel comfortable, start again!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-happened-and-how-it-felt">What happened and how it felt</h3>
<p>Carrying out the process I&rsquo;ve described above is becoming more fluid. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m aiming for it to be automatic, because the thinking (&ldquo;you got this, you have control of the club face, relax in balanced tension&rdquo;, etc) is a key part of the process.</p>
<p>The process works well. Not all the shots were great, but most were good or better. I totally mis-hit just a few balls this morning (less than 5, I think). This is a much better strike rate than I&rsquo;ve ever had before on the range. When it went wrong I often knew exactly why, could return to the process and hit the next one better. I took breaks to drink water, stretch and reset.</p>
<hr>
<p>This was a good practice session. Best of all, I feel a lot more confident with my driver heading into the competition tomorrow!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Competition Update:</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately my good driver feels at the range did not translate into my competition play.</p>
<p>I sliced my drive high and right on the first and it was difficult from that point to gain confidence back (because I only did that once while practising on the range, and didn&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d done differently this time).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I was feeling that settled in the process as I setup on course. I was distracted by a few things (related to the competition, pace of play, etc). My driver shots were mosly low -ish fades, with one high miss left and a couple more high slices right one of which was fine on 13 (because there was space). It was only on the 18th that I got a solid hit drawing slightly (which is the shape I like to see).</p>
<p>My fairway wood served me well for its designated tee shots on 4 and 16, not so good on 10 though.</p>
<p>Most other full shots did go well - ie my hybrids and irons were mainly good shots today (not always lucky shots though)!</p>
<p>My chipping was not at its best (but I was a bit rattled, so not relaxed enough). My putting was ok, but not good enough to save me any points!</p>
