        <p>Don&rsquo;t get too excited. I don&rsquo;t kitesurf (since a scary experience just after I finished lessons) and I haven&rsquo;t yet managed to get back on the windsurfer. I did make it to the beach&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;but it was way too windy and choppy for me to want to go out!</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s image shows just a few of the kites that were up. There was a competition in the bay, but it&rsquo;s often this busy anyway. D had a good sail, but even he said it was challenging. Glad I stayed on dry land!</p>
<p>Maybe tomorrow?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="reading">Reading:</h3>
<p>I finished the last of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosuke_Kindaichi">Detective Kindaichi</a> Mysteries by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seishi_Yokomizo">Seishi Yokomizo</a> earlier this week. It followed the same pattern, with quite a few deaths and a convoluted story of interpersonal relationships. This series brought back memories of reading detective novels as a teenager. Although I read a lot of contemporary fiction at that time, I also went through my parents collection of Penguin paperbacks. Dorothy L. Sayers and Ngaio Marsh were two of my favourite authors. Now I feel like going back to revisit those novels, although I wonder if I&rsquo;d enjoy them as much now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve moved on to other novels (not thrillers). In terms of nonfiction&hellip; well, I&rsquo;d like to get hold of a book I&rsquo;ve seen on <a href="https://uwap.uwa.edu.au/products/creating-black-cockatoo-friendly-suburbs">supporting black cockatoos in gardens</a> (although I&rsquo;m interested in supporting birdlife more broadly too), and I might even be interested in a research-related book!?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="golf">Golf:</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing ok at the moment, but very up and down. It has been hot, so I&rsquo;ve not been practising. I&rsquo;d really like to spend time on some basic drills and maybe get some coaching again. It&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to be completely consistent, but with some practice I really should be able to make my rounds less of a rollercoaster. I know I should spend at least some of that time on putting, but it&rsquo;s my least favourite thing to work on!</p>
<p>As it gets a bit cooler I&rsquo;m going to work out a practice schedule for myself. Setup and pre-shot routine will be the first things to get more comfortable with (across everything, from driving to putting). I could try changing my grip again (but that&rsquo;d really stuff everything up and I might just end up with sore fingers again, so maybe not a good idea).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise:</h3>
<p>I managed 20 minutes of home weights on top of my physio session and it was enough to make me sore the next day, so I did well this week. I&rsquo;d like to get to either one additional 30 minute session, or a couple of shorter ones each week ideally. I did some research (ie I used my academic library access) on osteoporosis and exercise, which reinforced the idea that weights at least a couple of times a week would be good for me. It&rsquo;s not enough to jump around (contra what you might see on social media). I&rsquo;d provide the research paper links here, but unfortunately they were all paywalled, so there&rsquo;s not much point sharing. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@elsand">Just ask</a> if you&rsquo;re interested in knowing more.</p>
<p>I contemplated going for a run this week, but it was hot and humid. I think I made the right call not going. I do feel as if I&rsquo;ll get back into it when it&rsquo;s cooler now.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="food">Food:</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to do ok in terms of eating. Had one takeaway this week, which helped because I&rsquo;ve been struggling to feel enthused about cooking, in particular when it&rsquo;s been hot.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="garden">Garden:</h3>
<p>This week I filled the bin with couch grass from the front garden. It had got out of hand and, even though it is almost impossible to remove compeltely, the bed looks a lot better now. I&rsquo;ll just need to keep removing it when it sprouts (trying to dig out as many of the runners as I can). Once I&rsquo;ve done that for a few weeks I might consider planting some more succulents or maybe natives (for birds etc). Whatever I plant needs to be drought tolerant (given no reticulation in that bed and my irregular hand waterering schedule to contend with)!</p>
<p>I bought two simple terracotta birdbath bowls, one for the front and one for the back. It was forecast to be hot and I wanted to give the birds somewhere to cool down and take a drink (also lizards, but I don&rsquo;t think we have that many at the moment). Both have definitely seen some action. I saw a raven drinking and cooling its feet out the front and a wagtail having a bath out the back.</p>
<p>I did buy a pot for the large cactus, but have not attempted to move it yet!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="adventure">Adventure:</h3>
<p>I got no further on organising wingfoiling lessons. Maybe that&rsquo;ll be easier if I have a try at windsurfing again when its a bit less ballistic?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="sewing">Sewing:</h3>
<p>The skirt-making project I&rsquo;ve been planning for weeks is in progress! It&rsquo;s imperative that I get this pattern to work - although I&rsquo;m very aware the first attempt might not be successful. More on this next week (I hope).</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="three-ideas">Three ideas:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Windsurfing&hellip; and/or get onto someone about wingfoiling lessons</li>
<li>Finish (?) the skirt, or at least get somewhere</li>
<li>Set aside 15 minutes to outline a potential journal article argument (or pull the pin officially)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The Work section was replaced with Sewing this week, hence the article argument appearing again in the three ideas list. I seem to have no desire to do research writing work at all. Suddenly all I wanted to do was to cut material and sew. Weird.</p>
