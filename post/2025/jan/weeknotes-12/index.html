        <p>A week in which it turned out that watching golf (ie walking the course with the players) is just as tiring physically as playing golf&hellip;</p>
<p>This week there was a professional competition at my club, so I got the chance to play another great local course for free (because we get offered alternative tee times elsewhere when we can&rsquo;t access our own course). However, this didn&rsquo;t mean I wasn&rsquo;t walking my own course, because I followed the golf competition for three days (well the pro am for one, then Friday and Sunday of the actual comp)! The cover image shows a view across the 18th hole.</p>
<p>Other than that, this week was much like last week: gardening, cooking and reading.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading:</h3>
<p>Still working through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosuke_Kindaichi">Detective Kindaichi</a> Mysteries by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seishi_Yokomizo">Seishi Yokomizo</a> series and not feeling the urge to read anything else other than blogs and a bit of news (but mostly skimming the latter). I&rsquo;m certainly not setting aside time for research-related reading right now (and this is giving me some anxiety, because I do have outstanding research writing on my list)!</p>
<p>The body count in each of the Kindaichi novels continues to be high!</p>
<h3 id="golf">Golf:</h3>
<p>Last week I noted that my golf had slumped, so it was great to play somewhere new this week. Being somewhere different alters your thinking about your game, because suddenly you&rsquo;re concentrating on working out what to do even more than usual, rather than the shot itself as one you&rsquo;ve played many times before. My playing partner had visited the course before so offered advice on some holes (ie &ldquo;avoid the left hand side&rdquo; or &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a sharp dog leg right here&rdquo;, etc). It was hot, so we were driving the round together sharing a cart, which meant I didn&rsquo;t get overtired (<a href="https://zigzaggery.space/post/2025/jan/weeknotes-05/">a feature of last week&rsquo;s experience</a>).</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise:</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, following the golf (not playing) has still meant I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of kms this week. Alongside working in the garden, this meant I skimped on home weights and only managed a quick body weight set of single leg exercises this week. I did have a proper physio weights session, which was focused on high repetitions of low-ish weight to fatigue (and in the heat that made me pretty nauseous). I clearly got to the stage when my red face suddenly turned white, because my physio made the choice to bail on the last set!</p>
<p>I would still like to get back to running, in part because I&rsquo;m watching my friends run via Strava and feeling guilty for not getting out myself. Still not sure whether that&rsquo;s enough to get me motivated though!</p>
<h3 id="food">Food:</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to cook a fair bit, in between being tired from walking and getting easy food options from the store. I took advantage of the cooler weather later in the week to cook chicken pasta and pork thai curry. It was good to leave the barbecue and salad behind for a couple of days.</p>
<h3 id="garden">Garden:</h3>
<p>I continued to prune and tidy the garden. I did some work in the front and back gardens this time. Pruning in the back I found the cactus (? could be a large succulent) that D says is a regular interloper from next door. When I cut that back I kept a few cuttings which I&rsquo;ve potted up. I must remember to water them! The green bin still has some space, so maybe I&rsquo;ll get back out there.</p>
<p>I am still putting off repotting the huge cactus&hellip; and that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;d like to find a nice pot (because I&rsquo;m not planning on moving it again any time soon). Finding something that I like (just something plain and simple) of the appopriate size has proved more difficult than I expected.</p>
<p>With no pot, I&rsquo;ve not yet organised help for the repotting task (see <a href="https://zigzaggery.space/post/2025/jan/weeknotes-05/">last week&rsquo;s three ideas</a> for this and in relation to Adventure and Work below).</p>
<h3 id="adventure">Adventure:</h3>
<p>We continue to discuss how to test my ability on the snow. Having snapped my ACL last time out, we know that I&rsquo;ll be petrified, but I&rsquo;m much stronger now too, so might get on ok. Planning a break where a couple of days skiing is an option seems like the best idea. Maybe Melbourne, Canberra or New Zealand (and I&rsquo;m pretty keen on the last of those).</p>
<p>I located three potential places for wingfoiling lessons, but haven&rsquo;t managed to decide on whether group lessons or individual are best for me. I can see pros and cons both ways. I think I might email each place to find out their reaction to teaching someone with a knee brace (because I&rsquo;m not trying anything new without using my brace). I guess I should write a post about the whole ACL/knee thing at some point.</p>
<h3 id="work-a-new-section">Work (a new section):</h3>
<p>I did not set aside a couple of hours to assess the feasability of the journal article I committed to write. I think I may need to approach this in 15 minute chunks (advice I happily give other people, but often do not take myself).</p>
<h3 id="three-ideas">Three ideas:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Book some wingfoiling lessons (on the basis of email responses about knees, maybe?!)</li>
<li>Organise cactus repotting (so, find and buy the damn pot!)</li>
<li>Set aside 15 minutes to assess the journal article writing (and hope this, or a few of these, will break the anxiety spiral)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Writing this weeknote I felt a bit flat. I enjoyed watching the golf, but it took up a lot of time. The gardening was definitely worthwhile and the food I cooked was good, but I have a lot of anxiety about research writing (aka my sword of Damocles) that has meant a lot of time spend avoiding the task (by doomscrolling mostly).</p>
