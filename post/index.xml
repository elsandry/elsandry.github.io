      <description>The week started well, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling tired a lot of the time&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;(my notes contain the word &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; more than once). Meh!&#xA;Cover image: Wind at Safety Bay for Wing-SUP session.</description>

      <description>Golf and not much else this week&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;felt bad about not doing other things (ie wing-SUPing) some days, but realise that&amp;rsquo;s a stupid reaction today. I spent a lot of time on something I enjoy, finding it both challenging and satisfying.</description>

      <title>Play golf: start and stay positive</title>

      <description>A round of golf is long&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and can become frustrating, even demoralising. Even when things have been going well it&amp;rsquo;s weirdly difficult to stay positive. Disaster can seem just around the corner.</description>

      <description>My range practice has almost becomes more about warmup strategy than anything else&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;because what I&amp;rsquo;m practising is the basics of contact, direction and distance. For a warmup I&amp;rsquo;ll work up the clubs (usually just odd/even irons to save time and balls) to driver.</description>

      <description>My chipping and pitching practice plans are in constant development&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;in part because there are two areas where I might practice that encourage the use of different intentions. Looking at the image above: one is the yellow rectangular chipping zone, the other is the practice green zone within the blue oval.</description>

      <description>These are my putting practice plans&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;for early 2026. (I&amp;rsquo;ve recycled an old image for the post, since the setup is still in use for part of the plan.)&#xA;Putting setup process I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new process for setting up to putt.</description>

      <description>I have played a lot of golf since my last golf-dedicated post from July 2025&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;a statement that covers range practice, social and competition rounds, because when I used the word &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; to talk about golf practice recently my coach questioned whether that description was helpful.</description>

      <description>A slightly disgruntling week&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;where I did manage to hold together a few things (but not golf on Friday)!&#xA;Cover image: not good quality, but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spook the very hot and thirsty kookaburra making use of the garden amenities.</description>

      <description>Some more bits and pieces of life, which is pretty slow atm&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;in part because it suddenly got hot. Luckily golf was on cooler days, but that meant it clashed with times I might have attempted to wing-SUP.</description>

      <description>First of the newstyle weeknotes&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;inspired by my love of reading weeknotes on The weblog of Alice Bartlett, which make me feel good about sharing bits and pieces of life without worrying that I need to entertain a reader other than me.</description>

      <description>A lot of good things happened in September, October and November&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to writing any weeknotes. In part that was because I was away quite a bit without my laptop.</description>

These travel notes continue for my benefit - a reminder of how anxiety can derail almost everything and then be gone once the feared action is past!</description>

      <description>Taking a break from weeknotes for a few weeks (but I will catch up)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;when I get back from travelling.&#xA;Already quite busy this week, so the photo above is actually from last week&amp;rsquo;s river walk!</description>

      <description>Went for a less travelled river walk&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;to see the end of the under-the-bridge art &amp;ldquo;gallery&amp;rdquo; (pictured above). Thought I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to get there for a bit, since there were lots of signs telling me the path was closed around Heathcote and past the yacht club, but it was all fine.</description>

      <description>Well, that seemed like a lot of rain (image above shows a still from the radar)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;which I know we need, but did we need it all at once?&#xA;The rain came in abundance a couple of times this week, with some very sunny weather in between.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s turned cold. There was frost on the practice range this morning (shown in image above)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but the cold doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me. So long as it&amp;rsquo;s not windy and raining I&amp;rsquo;ve been practising.</description>

      <description>Lots of golf and a new puzzle (pictured above)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;which I finished too quickly because I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop!&#xA;Reading: This week I read the new Rivers of London book, Stone and Sky, by Ben Aaronovitch.</description>

      <description>Began with rain, ended with rain, but sunny too&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;which meant some lovely skies at times (pictured for this post).&#xA;Reading: This week I re-read the first Murderbot story, All Systems Red, because I&amp;rsquo;m watching the television version and wanted to get a feel for how it&amp;rsquo;d been adapted, given that so much is explained in Murderbot&amp;rsquo;s thoughts or &amp;ldquo;on feeds&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Pretty good weather this week meant more outside activities&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;including a neighbourhood walk (with the pictured Bougainvillea in probably my favourite colour) being one of the sights. I also visited Booyeembara Park for the first time in years (having walked there regularly when our dog was getting old and needed short, but stimulating, walks).</description>

      <description>In an effort to stop leaving putts short (or at least reduce the issue)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out a new putting drill designed to improve pace feel and confidence putting across a range of distances.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done something like this before, thinking about setting the club off and then letting it move with its own momentum&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but this way of envisioning that process seems to work really well.</description>

      <description>Practice on the range convinced me I still needed to do more work on grip&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;developing a better process to setup my grip and movement to address the ball. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot already about grip and setup processes, but things have been morphing while I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since a dedicated golf update&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s been some weather getting in the way of practice and play. More broadly, I&amp;rsquo;ve not been feeling great (mentally), which leads to a lack of motivation and energy to practice.</description>

      <description>A quiet week watching the rain (and occasionally getting wet)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;so I got out one of my new jigsaw puzzles (partially pictured this week).&#xA;Reading: I forgot to read more of The AI Con and should get back to it since it&amp;rsquo;s one of the books I&amp;rsquo;ve started recommending to other people.</description>

      <description>Doing some unusual writing and the usual activities&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;which means I responded to the EPA against Woodside&amp;rsquo;s plans to drill under Scott Reef and played a lot of golf.&#xA;The image of a turtle this week was stolen from Save Scott Reef, but I hope that whoever took it won&amp;rsquo;t mind.</description>

      <description>We have had a few red-tailed black cockatoo visits for dinner now&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see them each time, although they make a hell of a mess under the tree with lots of small branches falling as they eat.</description>

      <description>Spent some money this week buying a graphic novel that was a PhD thesis and a great piece of art (both pictured in the image for this week)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;the first because Unflattening by Nick Sousanis sounds like a fascinating exploration of how words and images might be &amp;ldquo;inextricably linked&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;equal partners in meaning-making&amp;rdquo;, the second because it was the first piece of landscape art I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in ages that really called to me.</description>

      <description>The driver is a club I can hit really well - one of my first novelty prizes was for longest drive at my grade - but it is also the one that tests my skill and nerve the most&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This week it&amp;rsquo;s become clear I don&amp;rsquo;t take enough photographs&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;although that is, in part, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to pay more attention to what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing in the moment, rather than recording what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a bucket full of pain&amp;rdquo;, said the guy walking towards me with his mate as I headed to the driving range this morning&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t say that&amp;rdquo;, I replied, &amp;ldquo;we need to keep some positivity here&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>A week dominated by golf, as usual, with a bit of gardening and vote casting&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;in the Australian federal election.&#xA;Thank goodness we managed not to vote in Trump-lite and still hopeful my division might be led by an independent (although the race is very tight and won&amp;rsquo;t be decided until all the preferences are in).</description>

      <description>I think Joan Westenberg&amp;rsquo;s argument about backing systems over sparks is a great way to understand golf and how to improve one&amp;rsquo;s game&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;so I&amp;rsquo;ve written this quick post to draw out the words that hit home for me, because Westenberg probably (certainly?</description>

      <description>Just another week, with a lot of considering, not that much doing, but some good talking time&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;with D and G.&#xA;Reading: Still re-reading The Traveler&amp;rsquo;s Gate Trilogy by Will Wight, which I am enjoying a lot.</description>

      <description>Just over three weeks since my last golf update (other than mentions in weeknotes)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;safe to say things have been a bit up and down (and back up again).&#xA;The weather has cooled with storms and rain threatening to impact (see image above, taken just before I drove to the Wednesday competition this week), but largely not affecting, my practice and competition play.</description>

      <description>Filling in medical forms drains my energy as does playing trash golf, but my attempts to do things (whatever they might be) continue&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;while I&amp;rsquo;ve not implemented the block method from How to Do Things I have identified a few things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do in the next few months.</description>

      <description>A better week than last week, with a lot of smoke towards the end, but also lower temperatures&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;which meant I did get a few more things done this week (as well as playing quite a bit of golf at the course, pictured in the evening light for this week&amp;rsquo;s cover image).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to practice diligently, but with varied success&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;Tuesday went badly on the driving range at first, with lots of pulls left. After moving to the other practice area for some chipping in the zone (pictured above), I returned to hit another bucket of range balls a little better.</description>

      <description>I admit it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to write these weeknotes&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but keeping them going still seems useful. This week has been hot, with easterly winds of the type that have the potential to dry my eyes out so they burn.</description>

      <description>Continued regular practice chipping/pitching meant that, once again, I could move on to something new with my third golf lesson&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, changing my grip is an important part of this journey, but it&amp;rsquo;s so weird that during the back swing it feels like hitting the ball is a physical impossibility, except it then turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not (mostly).</description>

      <description>Took no proper photos this week, so here&amp;rsquo;s a really bad one of the river and ocean view through the gap between houses&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;for a week where I caught up with people I&amp;rsquo;d not seen for months and years respectively, while not looking forward to the return of summer temperatures in a few days time.</description>

      <description>This crow has probably seen a lot of me this week (image of the weeknote)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;as it flew around the golf course.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m so tired that as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this I really can&amp;rsquo;t think what to say (see Golf below).</description>

      <description>Finally got around to making the modified skirt for patterned materials with inset side seam pockets&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;which was an easy make (easier than expected) and bodes well for a make with the more expensive material I bought recently!</description>

      <description>So it begins&amp;hellip; the deconstruction of my golf swing&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;shortly followed by, I hope, its reconstruction in a new and better form!&#xA;The cover image for this post shows seven stages in the golf swing, modelled by a skeleton (which will be male, I think we can safely assume) taken from a 2022 review paper about golf swing biomechanics.</description>

      <description>Art, art and there should have been more art (but the opening times didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me), lunch, beach and golf&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;so I did well this week, but am annoyed I missed David Spencer&amp;rsquo;s Pentimento in Fremantle.</description>

      <description>The frangipanis are flowering and it&amp;rsquo;s getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important&amp;hellip;&#xA;Those plans for blogposts other than weeknotes are still just plans, so the frangipani flowers are the image of the week rather than gracing a post about the garden.</description>

      <description>Still trying to settle into my new life. I did manage to get a few things done while also trying to chill out (and avoid feeling like I have to do all the things all at once)&amp;hellip;</description>
