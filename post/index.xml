      <description>The frangipanis are flowering and it&amp;rsquo;s getting hotter more regularly now, so planning what to do and when is getting more important&amp;hellip;&#xA;Those plans for blogposts other than weeknotes are still just plans, so the frangipani flowers are the image of the week rather than gracing a post about the garden.</description>

      <description>Still trying to settle into my new life. I did manage to get a few things done while also trying to chill out (and avoid feeling like I have to do all the things all at once)&amp;hellip;</description>
