      <description>I think Joan Westenberg&amp;rsquo;s argument about backing systems over sparks is a great way to understand golf and how to improve one&amp;rsquo;s game&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;so I&amp;rsquo;ve written this quick post to draw out the words that hit home for me, because Westenberg probably (certainly?</description>

      <description>Just another week, with a lot of considering, not that much doing, but some good talking time&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;with D and G.&#xA;Reading: Still re-reading The Traveler&amp;rsquo;s Gate Trilogy by Will Wight, which I am enjoying a lot.</description>

      <description>Just over three weeks since my last golf update (other than mentions in weeknotes)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;safe to say things have been a bit up and down (and back up again).&#xA;The weather has cooled with storms and rain threatening to impact (see image above, taken just before I drove to the Wednesday competition this week), but largely not affecting, my practice and competition play.</description>

      <description>Filling in medical forms drains my energy as does playing trash golf, but my attempts to do things (whatever they might be) continue&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;while I&amp;rsquo;ve not implemented the block method from How to Do Things I have identified a few things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do in the next few months.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing with my time, other than trying to improve my golf, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I could be getting a little more done now I&amp;rsquo;ve been off work for a while&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>A better week than last week, with a lot of smoke towards the end, but also lower temperatures&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;which meant I did get a few more things done this week (as well as playing quite a bit of golf at the course, pictured in the evening light for this week&amp;rsquo;s cover image).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to practice diligently, but with varied success&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;Tuesday went badly on the driving range at first, with lots of pulls left. After moving to the other practice area for some chipping in the zone (pictured above), I returned to hit another bucket of range balls a little better.</description>

      <description>I admit it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to write these weeknotes&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but keeping them going still seems useful. This week has been hot, with easterly winds of the type that have the potential to dry my eyes out so they burn.</description>

      <guid>https://zigzaggery.space/post/2025/mar/aaargh-grip-change/</guid>
      <description>Continued regular practice chipping/pitching meant that, once again, I could move on to something new with my third golf lesson&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, changing my grip is an important part of this journey, but it&amp;rsquo;s so weird that during the back swing it feels like hitting the ball is a physical impossibility, except it then turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not (mostly).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few conversations in the last week or so, most recently with my golf coach, which have made me think about goals&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;in relation to golf and life more generally.</description>

      <description>Took no proper photos this week, so here&amp;rsquo;s a really bad one of the river and ocean view through the gap between houses&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;for a week where I caught up with people I&amp;rsquo;d not seen for months and years respectively, while not looking forward to the return of summer temperatures in a few days time.</description>

      <description>This crow has probably seen a lot of me this week (image of the weeknote)&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;as it flew around the golf course.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m so tired that as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this I really can&amp;rsquo;t think what to say (see Golf below).</description>

      <description>Finally got around to making the modified skirt for patterned materials with inset side seam pockets&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;which was an easy make (easier than expected) and bodes well for a make with the more expensive material I bought recently!</description>

      <description>A long weekend here that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel that way, with lots of golf, some music and pretty skies&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;that are pictured above and below. Still getting incandescently irritated with myself when I do something wrong, forget something and/or do nothing (ie procrastinate a day away).</description>

      <description>So it begins&amp;hellip; the deconstruction of my golf swing&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;shortly followed by, I hope, its reconstruction in a new and better form!&#xA;The cover image for this post shows seven stages in the golf swing, modelled by a skeleton (which will be male, I think we can safely assume) taken from a 2022 review paper about golf swing biomechanics.</description>

      <description>Good things, but personal frustration too&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;as I managed to do some of the things, but not all of the things (and didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to let go of irritation with myself as the week moved by).</description>

      <description>Art, art and there should have been more art (but the opening times didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me), lunch, beach and golf&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;so I did well this week, but am annoyed I missed David Spencer&amp;rsquo;s Pentimento in Fremantle.</description>

      <description>Back down to the windsurfing beach this week and I had a go this time&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;but it didn&amp;rsquo;t go great!&#xA;On a positive note, all my new kit fitted well, I was very comfortable and my leg brace felt fine (so fine that really I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice it at all unless I was kneeling on the board trying to uphaul).</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t get too excited. I don&amp;rsquo;t kitesurf (since a scary experience just after I finished lessons) and I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet managed to get back on the windsurfer. I did make it to the beach&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For some reason this was a week dominated by irritability&amp;hellip;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and I&amp;rsquo;m not absolutely sure why. It might have something to do with wanting to feel I&amp;rsquo;m improving my golf game (but still only managing to play well for half any given round).</description>

      <description>A week in which it turned out that watching golf (ie walking the course with the players) is just as tiring physically as playing golf&amp;hellip;&#xA;This week there was a professional competition at my club, so I got the chance to play another great local course for free (because we get offered alternative tee times elsewhere when we can&amp;rsquo;t access our own course).</description>
